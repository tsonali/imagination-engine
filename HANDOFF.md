# HANDOFF — resume here (read this first)

_Last updated 2026-08-28 beat200 (sonali-b5 session) — **SHIP GATE HOLDS. Root-caused the flagship comp-vf-wrong-entity family (6+ regressions across beats 94/103/119/153/196/197/199) to a single shared bug: beat197's fix put a grounding sentence — "Facts under '## People' belong to the named OTHER person (a sister, brother, friend, partner, etc.)" — directly into `vital_facts.py context_block()`'s header, which is unconditionally included in the string every downstream keyword-matcher scans. `companion.py _vf_covers_query()`'s relationship-word check matched that instruction TEXT itself ("brother", "friend", "partner") rather than the user's actual facts, so it returned True for any relationship-word query as long as ANY vital fact existed at all — defeating both the PAST-QUERY affirmation guard (wrongly affirms the wrong entity) and SC13-CROSS-ENTITY (whose trigger requires `_vf_covers_query()`==False to fire, so it silently never fired when it needed to). Confirmed by direct repro (VF with only a sister → query about "brother Marcus" → wrongly returned True) and independently reconfirmed by a background agent's honest read of a fresh battery9 log surfacing the same contamination via a DIFFERENT path (the generic-probe-yes branch volunteering an unrelated VF fact on a topic-less probe). Fix: new `_vf_content_only()` strips the header/footer via its fixed `-----` markers before matching; wired into `_vf_covers_query()` and `_has_unrecognized_name()`. 8 direct unit tests incl. FP checks (real coverage — sister-on-file query, proper-noun "Priya" query — still correctly returns True). Second fix: `drop_crutch_word_overuse()` (beat198) only matched the bare adjective "particular"/"specific", not the adverb form — a background agent's honest read of battery11_1912 found "specifically" surviving 12x and 4x in two scripts even after 25+ other crutch sentences were dropped from the same scripts; extended to `particular(?:ly)?|specific(?:ally)?`. Both verified py_compile + `scripts/test_postcheck.py` (ALL PASS) + direct unit tests with FP guards — no model launch (qc_queue's battery9_engagement/companion_deep_test ran the whole beat, memory as low as 15% free). companion.py MD5: 35aaaa6dbeb6e2431cf8a62e6dbab18d. postcheck.py MD5: 719db90d47967a906c6c786cc3cc6644. ZIP MD5: e0e2d593ae6af36f64382a44f69ec47f. Read 2 large backlog logs via background agents (battery11_1912, battery9_2039) + 5 small logs directly (all clean) — surfaced 3 more real defects each, not yet fixed, logged in review-queue.md for next beat: companion's comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat T5==T4 exact-duplicate output despite 2 guards firing, 2 more semantic-paraphrase-echo instances, a possible gold-exemplar-overfitting signal; imagination's imag-intimacy pronoun-case collapse + dropped-apostrophe contractions, an intake-turn gendered-pronoun leak no postcheck inspects, a chair-bleed/orphan-fragment recurrence in 2 more scenario types. Gold(A) +5 (chess tournament checkmate, vintage car engine restart, tattoo finishing, cheese-aging first taste, stone-skipping PR), NOT SCP'd (mini unreachable, 74th+ consecutive beat). 2 peer sessions active, coordination broadcast sent to both, no replies, no duplication.

_Previously (2026-08-28 beat199, sonali-d2 session) — **SHIP GATE HOLDS. Root-caused and fixed a repeat Secretary regression: battery10's self-flagged `LOST:bug-count` ("3 bugs" → "3" dropped from organized output) traced to `utility.py`'s last-resort number-injection using plain substring matching (`n in ln`) instead of the already-defined word-boundary `_num_present()` helper to find a missing bare-digit number's source sentence — for `n="3"`, substring matching picked an unrelated earlier sentence containing "30%" (since "3" is a substring of "30") before ever reaching the real "3 bugs" sentence, corrupting both the regen-guidance prompt and the last-resort injector. `_num_present()` already existed in the same function scope (built by beat53 for exactly this class of bug) but wasn't called at either of the 2 substring-match sites that needed it — now fixed and verified via standalone repro against the exact scenario source + exact defective output from the log. utility.py MD5: c7eac2ae904c28a6edce0d405d9f6b52. ZIP MD5: e9f13f357dfa6fc2b5a16d1f4a9f2b07. Read 3 backlog QC logs via parallel background agents — surfaced but did not fix (logged in review-queue.md for next beat): a 6th recurring instance of the flagship comp-vf-wrong-entity misattribution family (Marcus query answered with Priya data); comp-past-query over-volunteering unprompted VF detail on a topic-less probe; a new systemic semantic-paraphrase-echo gap (2 instances, same family beat196 flagged); a companion self-repeat-as-memory-answer; a BYO implicit-confirmation honesty-floor slip. No model launch — pure-function fix, verification is direct repro against the exact defect string (no dedicated test_utility.py exists for this file). Gold(A) +5 (gargoyle carving, shipwreck cabin penetration, mountain unicycle descent, ham radio DX contact, hand-stitched boots), NOT SCP'd (mini unreachable, 73rd+ consecutive beat). 2 peer sessions active, coordination broadcast sent, no duplication.

_Previously (2026-08-28 beat198, sonali-62 session) — **SHIP GATE HOLDS. Took on beat196/197's escalated "2nd→3rd-person narrator drift" finding (3 prior beats declined even a literal patch, judging it unsafe) and landed the first safe general rule: new `fix_third_person_alone_drift()` in postcheck.py catches "they're/they are alone" (0 legitimate gold instances, verified first) and fixes any "their" in the same sentence to "your" — real progress on a 3-beat-stalled item, though the other drift shapes beat196 found remain open. Also closed a separately 3-beat-confirmed gap: new `drop_crutch_word_overuse()` gives the beat88 "particular"/"specific" ban (previously prompt-text only, and not even inherited by SETTLING_PROMPT) its first mechanical backstop, same "keep first 2, drop 3rd+" convention as `repair_short_phrase_repeats`. Read `queue_0828_1317_battery11_imagination_bank.log` via a background agent (full honest transcript) and fixed 4 more real defects: "you're both" eagle-companion contraction escape + a narrowly-scoped "flock as agentic guide" pattern (5 regex entries, verified 0 hits against the full gold corpus first — a legitimate murmuration-embodiment scenario type must not be touched); new `fix_predicative_her()` (her/hers sibling of the existing your/yours fixer); present-tense "returns" added to the your-bare-subject-verb dict; 2 more literal patches for the beat187 verb-governed-your family. Investigated but deliberately did NOT fix a plausible-looking "Would I carry" narrator-leak patch after finding genuine legitimate gold usage of both "I carry" and "would I" as a deliberate first-person register in a different scenario style — flagged the real open question (is `clean_narrator_possessives` scenario-gated at all?) for a future beat. All verified py_compile + `scripts/test_postcheck.py` (ALL PASS) + direct unit tests against every exact defect string + FP checks — no model launch (qc_queue's own battery9_engagement ran the whole beat, memory 9-32% free). postcheck.py MD5: 68a863da9328c09f47fb6598dc5e4a03. generator.py MD5: 57df368a95206f10af223575c47bc0e1.

_Previously (2026-08-28 beat196, sonali-da session) — **SHIP GATE HOLDS. Backlog of 4 large unread logs (battery11_2152 [beat195's flagged priority], battery11_0255, battery9_2305, battery9_0422) read via 4 parallel background agents; 7 smaller logs read directly, all mechanically clean (battery12 41/41, byo_deep_test 18/18 anchored PASS, battery9's own metrics 17-22% question-enders — sustained well under the 50% target). TWO mechanical fixes landed: (1) postcheck.py — raw "_blank_" sentinel-token leak in a severely decayed imag-intimacy script (battery11_0255), zero prior coverage anywhere, would have been spoken verbatim by TTS; new `_STRAY_SENTINEL_TOKEN_RE` wired into `strip_back_instruction_leaks()`. (2) companion.py — raw "(2026-07)" date tag from vital-facts.md echoed verbatim into a spoken reply (battery9_0422 comp-vf-wrong-entity T2); unconditional final-pass strip closes every regen path. ALSO recovered and landed a peer session's complete, verified, uncommitted battery11_2152 fixes found already on disk (dist already synced) — `fix_your_subject_pronoun()` (5th your/yours escape shape) + 3 new eagle anon-companion phrasings ("the two of you", "two of us", "someone else has found their way") — verified independently (py_compile + full test suite + scenario_bank import) before trusting the inline comments and committing together with this beat's own work (commit 58b4207) rather than leaving it stranded for a 3rd beat. All fixes verified via py_compile + `scripts/test_postcheck.py` (ALL PASS) + direct unit tests against exact defect strings + FP checks — no model launch (memory 8-13% free the entire beat, qc_queue's own `companion_deep_test.py` running throughout). companion.py MD5: f00157fc5bbdcd14828fda3a38f350f3. postcheck.py MD5: 238007bcd0dc7f19731ae852cc9808e6.

HIGHEST-PRIORITY OPEN FINDING (not fixed, needs next beat): VF fabrication ("without the kids around" — misattributed the sister's kids to the user) AND the date-tag leak both landed on the two designated fallback/safety-net paths (second-pass forced response, VF-affirmative regen) in the SAME scenario — worth investigating whether these fallback paths get systematically less scrutiny than the primary generation path, a structural risk to the product's core memory/honesty trust proposition. Also escalated: 2nd→3rd-person narrator drift (beat185 logged once for imag-mri, deferred; this beat found it recurring 15+ times in a second, unrelated scenario type — confirmed systemic, zero mechanical coverage, needs a dedicated design pass, not a literal patch). Full detail on both plus 5 more lower-confidence single-instance findings in review-queue.md and daily-log.md. Gold(A) +5 fresh domains (sword-forging, exoplanet confirmation, whittling, submarine watch, highline crossing), NOT SCP'd (mini unreachable, 70th+ consecutive beat, same DNS signature — Sonali's physical check remains the recommended next step).

_Previously (2026-08-27 beat195, sonali-08 session) — **SHIP GATE HOLDS. On arrival, found 5 peer sessions active on this machine; sent a coordination broadcast (per beat189/191 practice) before touching anything, then claimed and read `queue_0827_1746_battery9_engagement.log` (beat194's flagged priority, 116KB) via a background agent, plus 9 other logs completed since beat194's commit read directly. HIGHEST PRIORITY FIX (companion.py, structural gap in the PAST-QUERY memory system): `companion_deep_test_1944` UC2 T4 — the topic-less "Did we talk about this before?" got falsely denied ("No — we haven't discussed anything...") despite 2 seeded past summaries specifically covering the topic, contradicting T2's own light reference to the same history two turns earlier. Root cause was two-fold: (1) the whole PAST-QUERY affirm/deny coverage system only ever triggered on replies starting with "you haven't"/"I haven't" — this reply was natively generated already in the canonical "No — we haven't discussed..." shape and never reached the coverage check; (2) `_vf_covers_query`/`_past_covers_query` both require a keyword/entity match in the query text, which a genuinely topic-less query can never provide by construction, regardless of how much real history exists. Fixed both: broadened the trigger to catch natively-canonical "No —..." replies (verified specific-but-genuinely-uncovered topics still deny correctly — strictly additive); new `_is_generic_memory_probe()` treats a topic-less probe as covered when `self._past` is non-empty, reusing the existing "Yes" regen path so the model states a real remembered detail instead of inventing one; guarded against double-prepending "No — " on the already-canonical path. Verified with direct pure-Python unit tests against the exact defect string + 3 FP cases — no model launch (battery11 was mid-run all beat, memory 0.4-14% free). No automated assertion exists for this (companion_deep_test.py is a human-read checklist by design) — next companion_deep_test cycle's honest read is the verification point. Process note: accidentally ran a model-dependent test script while battery11 held the only safe model slot at 0.4% free — crashed itself on Metal OOM as expected, confirmed no damage to battery11/qc_queue, did not repeat the mistake. companion.py MD5: a81186a4cfedadc1bb3b3674d1b94985.

_Previously (2026-08-27 beat194, sonali-69 session) — **SHIP GATE HOLDS. Recovered and landed an uncommitted, interrupted-session fix found on arrival (companion.py mtime 14:47, no matching HANDOFF/log entry — same shape as beat188's recovery): CONFIRM_LANDS was truncating an already-correct vital-facts affirmation ("Yes. Your sister Priya lives in Austin, two kids." → bare "Yes.") because it starts with the "yes." land phrase. Independently re-verified before trusting it (reproduced the defect string standalone + explicit FP check that ordinary non-memory-probe "Yes, exactly." lands still truncate) rather than taking the inline comment on faith. Also removed a stray stale root-level hearth-0.2.zip (Aug 18) left outside dist/ from an earlier ad hoc run. Then delegated a full honest read of the still-unread queue_0827_1628_battery11_imagination_bank.log to a background agent (7 scenarios) — found 3 real defects, 2 of them genuinely new surface forms: (1) postcheck.py chair-bleed family missing "chair or ground" (imag-eagle-golden-eagle-wildlife false PASS); (2) postcheck.py narrator-leak allowlist had bare "start" but not past-tense "started" ("I started my flight" leak, imag-eagle-companion-bird-he); (3) HIGHER-PRIORITY structural gap: MRI rehearsal scripts hallucinate a female companion ("Her arms are along her sides now, as she shifts...") with zero mechanical coverage — the existing drop_hallucinated_she_her() call is gated on `_is_active_body`, which requires a motion keyword and is structurally False for MRI (lying still isn't "in motion"); same gap beat185 logged for a different MRI instance ("Frank") and left open, now closed by extending the gate to `_is_active_body or _rehearsal_env == "MRI tube"` (still behind the existing _female_in_intake safety check). All 3 verified with direct unit tests against the exact transcript quotes + FP checks (legitimate "chair or garden bench" untouched, 2nd-person "You start your flight" untouched, "reinstarted" word-boundary sanity, MRI she/her drop function itself confirmed correct on the exact quote). py_compile clean, test_postcheck.py ALL PASS. Two other findings from the same read confirmed as already-known, still-open recurrences (not fixed — no new information): imag-intimacy's "her eyes find your then" / "particular" template fatigue (beat187's literal patches confirmed not to generalize, as beat187 itself predicted). companion.py MD5: e3fef11d58b296d6dfa055dbb1cf6063. postcheck.py MD5: b992d6c08fda2c9b48745ec865e4483c. generator.py MD5: db7929985ab1649b9d139945268b261a.

_Previously (2026-08-27 beat193) — **SHIP GATE HOLDS. battery11_0827_0453 read (background agent, full honest read of the "41 PASS / 7 FAIL" rollup — real result was 35/35 PASS, 0 FAIL). FIXED the queue.log rollup-counting bug itself (flagged since beat178, never fixed until now): `grep -c 'PASS'/'FAIL'` was counting the substring anywhere in the log including inside historical regression-note docstrings; now anchored on the leading-checkmark line format (`^\s*✅`/`^\s*❌`), verified against 4 fresh logs to match honest-read results exactly. HIGHEST PRIORITY FIX (new defect class): imag-intimacy leaked a raw chat-template special token (`<|im_start|>`) plus a hallucinated fake `!user` turn containing self-referential meta-commentary about its own generation ("The script ended on the same idea multiple times which broke the immersion") — zero mechanical coverage anywhere, same family as beat187's "DataExchange completed" tool-call-text leak but a new surface form (standalone token + fake turn, not word-fused). New `postcheck.py` `_CHAT_TEMPLATE_TOKEN_RE` + `_FAKE_TURN_MARKER_RE` (strip raw tokens/fake turn markers, wired into `strip_back_instruction_leaks()` before sentence splitting) + a new `_BACK_LEAK_PATTERNS` entry for the self-referential "the script...broke...immersion" sentence shape. Also fixed this beat: 4 new eagle anon-companion escape surface forms ("both of your figures", "matching theirs", "both move together", "either of you" — 3-way parity across postcheck.py/generator.py/battery11_imagination_bank.py, all TPs caught + all FP shapes clean); imag-intimacy's "your underneath" object-pronoun escape, narrowly scoped to the terminal (end-of-clause) case only, since a broader rule would break the legitimate "your underneath layer" attributive use; companion.py's "That breaks the script." bare non-sequitur reply (battery2b_honesty) — root cause was the model copying COMPANION_SYSTEM's own illustrative example text ("Anger at a miscarriage, not sadness — that breaks the script.") near-verbatim via the no-echo regen path, which resends the full system prompt; `_VAGUE_FILLER_RE` extended with the bare verb-form shape ("X breaks the script" with nothing else), elaborated/legitimate uses of the phrase (like the system prompt's own example) stay unaffected by construction. All fixes verified py_compile + `scripts/test_postcheck.py` (ALL PASS) + direct unit tests against every exact defect string quoted above + explicit FP checks for each — no model launch (memory was as low as 0.4% free for most of the beat; qc_queue's own battery9_engagement was already mid-run at beat start and was NOT paused, since no model launch of my own was needed). companion.py MD5: c8a34d8598c2e009d599c60b4438e8b1. postcheck.py MD5: 5056154d60fe568a967328f7b7f0e6ef. generator.py MD5: 8f84044c8eeeeab4bd427aba103955bd. battery11_imagination_bank.py MD5: 760b01cbb87021e6a5b7bf82ea15d326.

_Previously (2026-08-27 beat192) — **SHIP GATE HOLDS. Beat started with qc_queue mid-battery (battery9_engagement, memory 17-23% free — well under the 35% launch floor), so no model was launched; all fixes verified via pure Python/regex unit tests. Read beat191's unread logs (battery11_0826_2346 + 8 overnight batteries) via 2 background agents. HIGHEST PRIORITY FIX: companion.py's VF-BROAD-INCOMPLETE reply claimed a user's own vital-fact as its own — battery12 SC3 (the flagship "vital facts" feature's own test) returned "Yes — i'm the product lead at Hearth. Your sister Priya lives in Austin and has two kids." — the SAME reply correctly used "Your sister" for one fact but claimed the OTHER as its own in first person. New `_fix_vf_first_person_misattribution()` guard swaps any clause-opening "I'm"/"I am" that names vital-facts content to "You're"/"You are"; battery12 SC3 got a new p4 regression check (asserts the fix is a no-op on the corrected reply). Also fixed: postcheck.py's your/yours escape family grew a 4th distinct grammatical shape ("move past your a step or two" — "your" standing in for the primary object pronoun "you" itself, not a possessive-vs-standalone confusion like the prior 3) — found a general zero-FP rule (possessive determiner can never precede an indefinite article) rather than another literal patch; a sibling of the beat146 copula bug ("than your alone" → broken "than you're alone", the fixer itself introducing the defect, same as beat146's "is your alone" case but with "than" instead of a copula); eagle "this other animal" anon-companion escape (3-way parity). Logged not fixed (need dedicated design, banked in scenario_bank.py + review-queue.md): imag-calm-settle's phantom-second-person gap ("neither of you", "you both" in a solo scene) — the existing guard is eagle-gated by design, extending it safely needs a cross-scenario-type "what counts as solo" design pass; Secretary's lossless-number injection reading unnatural under stress ("Q3/16 months/11 months" slash-jammed); BYO's identical honesty-floor phrasing reused verbatim across 3+ distinct personas. companion.py MD5: 08d13b4deb8cec9bf1ccd8f76fd74fd8. postcheck.py MD5: 737bd500e1668deaf7d6f7b6c3150721. generator.py MD5: f344c4ae5247bccd2022f26b235015fb. battery11_imagination_bank.py MD5: 9cb7f181bcaf32df62b487f2fea21e05.

This silently defeated beat187's own fix from the moment it landed, for what was actually its most common case.

_Previously (2026-08-26 beat191) — **SHIP GATE HOLDS. First beat run by a fresh session (sonali-4a) alongside 2 already-active peer sessions — coordinated via SendMessage before touching anything model-related, confirmed via `/tmp/hearth-heartbeat.lock` (PID of the launchd wrapper) that this run legitimately holds the heartbeat slot. Read the backlog of unread logs: companion_deep_test_2136 directly (small), battery11_1854 and battery9_2001 via 2 background agents (large transcripts). 6 code fixes, all verified with direct unit tests against exact transcript quotes + FP checks, no model launch. HIGHEST PRIORITY: companion_deep_test UC2 T4 asked "Did we talk about this before?" about a topic the seeded past-summaries genuinely covered — got "No — we haven't discussed the job specifics before. I know you're still leaning toward taking a risk..." — a self-contradicting denial-then-affirmation. Two root causes, both fixed in companion.py: (1) the PAST-QUERY VF-yes-regen guard only ever checked vital_facts.md coverage, never cross-session past-summary coverage (a separate memory source) — new `_past_covers_query()` mirrors the existing `_vf_covers_query()` against `self._past`; (2) entity-less follow-ups ("did we talk about this before?") can't be resolved by keyword coverage at all, and the model's raw reply already contained the contradiction verbatim — new `_pq_contradicting_trailer()` detects a 2-sentence denial+real-fact-overlap shape and regens a clean affirmation instead. Other fixes: Case 2h echo guard got a scoped anger/angry lemma-normalization (3rd separate guard this exact pair has now defeated — beat166 fixed the second-pass path, beat184 fixed Case 2f, this beat fixes Case 2h, all via a benign trailing question pushing total reply length past each guard's word-count gate); `_strip_thats_real_tic()` got a new "[1-2 words] is what's real [here]" stamp variant (no em-dash, no literal "that's real" string — invisible to every prior pattern); eagle anon-companion pattern lists (postcheck.py + generator.py + battery11_imagination_bank.py, 3-way parity) got 4 new escape forms from a battery11 honest read ("not just one bird but two", "formation with you", "this pairing", "at its side"). Logged but NOT fixed this beat (need careful design, banked in scenario_bank.py + review-queue.md for a future beat): imag-intimacy's worst script in the batch — a genuinely new first-person "mine"/"me" narrator leak into the 2nd-person address (5+ recurrences in one script), spurious "hers'"/"yours'" trailing apostrophes, and a possible one-off token-corruption artifact ("Rtilt"); battery9's coordinate noun-phrase recombination echo (4 instances, dilutes every existing overlap threshold) and referentially-dangling-clause outputs. companion.py MD5: 659008912c4dc1a062bccc2191624323. postcheck.py MD5: e6b0580d42de0d9ea7eceede0aee89ce. generator.py MD5: b25ece96f1167875f6470429ed5d0adc.

_Previously (2026-08-26 beat188) — **SHIP GATE HOLDS.

Verified line-by-line against cited log sources rather than trusted blind — py_compile clean, scripts/test_postcheck.py ALL PASS — then landed as commit 526f864: companion.py VF-BROAD-INCOMPLETE guard (a broad "what do you remember about me" probe must surface every vital-facts line, not just the first), GRAVITY terminal floor (mechanical fallback guarantees a follow-up question survives every regen path at the single most safety-relevant scenario in the product), SC13-CROSS-ENTITY broadened to catch a perspective-inverted wrong-entity volunteer with no yes/no marker (4th regression of this class), a silently-broken curly-apostrophe regex fix, a hollow-filler tail-word cap widen; postcheck.py _YOUR_PREP_OBJECT_RE broadened to the full preposition set; an eagle acoustic anon-companion class (3-way parity); a utility.py preposition fix.

Root cause: the VF-probe prompt had a literal concrete example the model was copying content from when the real file only had one fact — FIXED by replacing the example with an abstract instruction + an explicit no-padding rule. Also read beat185's 2 priority verification logs (battery11_2235, battery9_0004) via 2 background agents: confirmed beat185's Case 2i fix has a real live gap (the exact target string still reaches users via the second-pass forced-response path, which deliberately skips `_strip_echo()` — FIXED by extracting the bigram-echo check into a shared helper used by both paths, same "second path never got the fix" shape as beat184's Case 2f bug); 2 more "your"+adjective escapes (literal-patched, generalization investigated and safely deferred with a documented counterexample); a 3rd occurrence of the eagle human-bystander hallucination (5 new patterns, 3-way parity); a VAGUE_FILLER "for"-preposition gap.

_Previously (2026-08-25 beat185) — SHIP GATE HOLDS. Read the post-beat184 priority verification logs (battery11_1832, battery9_2002, via 2 background agents) plus battery6_crosscut and battery10_registers (direct reads, both clean). Neither priority log was fully clean: battery11 confirmed the eagle narrator-leak fix held, but the two "your"-pronoun-misuse fixes did NOT — the 6th straight beat of the same escape shape recurring with new trigger words. battery9 confirmed the specific reported Case 2i string was fixed but found the SAME restatement class one scenario over, plus a mid-reply "it sounds like" leak and a turn-1 fabricated-callback FYI. Rather than add a 7th literal patch, GENERALIZED the "your" fix in postcheck.py: (1) "your" can never grammatically precede a preposition (safe, zero-FP rule) — broadened the non-noun follow-set with a full preposition list; (2) a curated bare-subject-verb list ("your sits/stands/..." -> "you sit/stand/..."). 4/5 known escapes now fixed; the 5th (adjective-follow) logged open. companion.py: new Case 2i short-first-sentence branch (declarative-only, literal 2-gram content-bigram check) catches the cross-sentence echo without misfiring on genuine clarifying questions; new unconditional final-pass strip for "it sounds like" wherever it appears (COMPANION_SYSTEM bans it everywhere, not just as an opener — Case 2l' only caught position zero). All 3 fixes verified with py_compile + direct unit tests against the exact defect strings + FP suites (12 checks for the postcheck fix, 6 for the companion fix) — no model launch, no battery execution, per beat181's lesson. Committed a1028c4. ALSO this beat: resolved beat184's flagged structural question myself (full delegation — decide, don't ask) by folding `scripts/qc/companion_deep_test.py` directly into qc_queue.sh's QUEUE rotation array, ending its 90+ beat starvation (last standalone run was beat92) — the queue's existing memory/concurrency gating already covers it safely, this was a pure omission. Restarted qc_queue clean (killed in-flight battery2b, verified lock-dir teardown, confirmed memory recovered to 80% free, relaunched, PID 64491) so the fix is live this pass. Gold(A)=6580 (+5, all term-frequency-checked, 0 prior hits; caught and fixed 2 of my own drafts using banned "specific way"/"candlelight" phrasing before writing them).

BEAT186 SUMMARY (2026-08-26):
- Read queue_0825_2235_battery11_imagination_bank.log and queue_0826_0004_battery9_engagement.log (beat185's priority verification runs) via 2 background agents. Read queue_0826_0151_companion_deep_test.log directly (small, 8.5KB) — **first standalone run in 90+ beats**, completed under beat185's new qc_queue rotation slot.
- companion_deep_test verdict: 3/3 UCs (16 turns) mechanically clean against the promotion-bar checklist except ONE real defect — UC2 T4 fabricated a biographical fact (see FIX 1 below). Two soft FYIs logged (UC2 T1 possible light memory-reference on a fresh session; UC1 T4/T5 near-repeat action bridges after a regen already fired) — neither a hard floor violation, both want a 2nd instance.
- FIX 1 (companion.py `_vf_probe_supplement`, HIGH PRIORITY): the VF-probe instruction prompt contained a literal concrete example ending "...You're a product lead at Hearth." With a real vital-facts.md that has only ONE fact (sister/Priya), the model reproduced the example's second fact verbatim as if it were real user data — "Yes — you're a product lead at Hearth" on a topic-less "did we talk about this before?" probe. Same bug class generator.py's FORBIDDEN PHRASES already guards against explicitly; this in-prompt example just hadn't been sanitized. Replaced the concrete example with an abstract instruction + an explicit "state only what's there, don't pad a thin file with an invented fact" rule.
- FIX 2 (companion.py Case 2i, confirmed live regression): battery9_0004 reproduced the EXACT beat185-target string ("The work thing is keeping you awake at 2am.") identically in 2 scenarios. Root cause: Case 2i's bigram-echo check lives inside `_strip_echo()`, which `turn()`'s second-pass forced-response path deliberately skips by design. The second-pass path's own guard (beat173 Fix G, full-Jaccard) doesn't substitute — Jaccard on this exact string is ~0.19, the same dilution problem beat185's bigram check solved for the first-pass path. Extracted `_i_to_you()` and the bigram-loop into shared module-level `_bigram_content_echo()`, wired into both Case 2i and a new second-pass guard. Same shape as beat184's Case 2f bug (fix lands on primary path, parallel second-pass chain doesn't inherit it) — now a named, watched category of bug in this file.
- FIX 3 (postcheck.py): 2 more "your"+ADJECTIVE escapes ("releases your long enough", "of your close around") — literal-patched. Investigated a general 2-word-lookahead rule but found "beneath your long shadow" as a real counterexample (legitimate your+adjective+NOUN) that a naive version would break; documented in code so a future attempt doesn't redo the analysis.
- FIX 4 (postcheck.py + generator.py + battery11_imagination_bank.py, 3-way parity): 3rd occurrence of the eagle human-bystander hallucination (beat178's class), new phrasing ("a figure below", "someone sitting", "not a hiker", "someone has been walking", "human presence") — 5 new pattern alternatives added to all 3 files.
- FIX 5 (companion.py VAGUE_FILLER): added "for [phrase]" alongside the existing "of [phrase]" suffix — "That's the whole script for staying quiet" wasn't covered by beat155's fix.
- All 5 fixes verified py_compile + direct unit tests against the exact defect strings + FP suites (attributive "your long hair"/"of your own choosing", legitimate clarifying questions, non-vague long replies) — no model launch beyond qc_queue's own single process (beat181's lesson). companion.py/postcheck.py/generator.py synced to all 4 copies (src + 3 dist). ZIP rebuilt twice. Final MD5s in header above.
- Gold(A) 6580→6585 (+5): vet-says-rescue-kitten-will-make-it, your-name-called-as-winner-you-didnt-expect, final-note-of-your-solo-room-goes-silent, recovery-room-chair-waiting-for-them-to-wake, biopsy-callback-benign-on-the-drive-home. Freshness-checked (avoided grandmother/inherit at 55 hits, handwriting at 38 hits; picked 0-5-hit themes).
- Gold(C) +2 (c_gold_beat186.jsonl): vf-single-fact-no-padding, cross-sentence-echo-not-restatement — both targeting this beat's real defects directly.
- Mini: UNREACHABLE (63rd consecutive) — signature CHANGED: `arp -a` now shows the mac-mini host entirely absent (was "present but incomplete" in recent beats). This laptop's current network (per full `arp -a`) has no mac-mini entry of any kind, though other named devices are present — worth Sonali knowing when she does the physical check beats 184/185 recommended.
- qc_queue healthy throughout (PID 64491), memory recovered to 81% free at beat close, no battery in flight. companion_deep_test now in steady rotation; next run is the priority verification point for this beat's Case 2i second-pass fix and VF single-fact fix.

NEXT:
(1) Next companion_deep_test cycle (PRIORITY): verify the VF single-fact-no-padding fix and confirm no new fabrication on the same UC2 T4-style vague probe.
(2) Next battery9 cycle (PRIORITY): verify the Case 2i second-pass bigram-echo fix — watch specifically for the "work thing"/comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat family and any other second-pass-path echo that a first-pass-only fix might have missed before.
(3) Next battery11 cycle: verify the 2 new "your"+adjective literal patches and the 5 new eagle human-bystander patterns.
(4) UC2 T1 soft memory-reference FYI (beat186, new): watching for a 2nd instance.
(5) UC1 T4/T5 near-repeat action bridge FYI (beat186, new): watching for a 2nd instance.
(6) Mini SSH: 63rd attempt failed with a changed signature (host absent from ARP, not just "incomplete") — flag the network-mismatch possibility to Sonali when she checks physically.
(7) Sonali: push v1.0 tag (git push origin v1.0). Only Sonali-physical: notarization + F5 voice dial.

BEAT185 SUMMARY (2026-08-25):
- Read queue_0825_1832_battery11_imagination_bank.log and queue_0825_2002_battery9_engagement.log (beat184's priority verification runs) via 2 background agents; queue_0825_2158_battery6_crosscut.log and queue_0825_2203_battery10_registers.log read directly (both clean).
- battery11 verdict: eagle narrator-leak fix (beat184 fix #3) held clean across all 4 eagle scripts. The two "your"-misuse fixes (#1 whenever-gap, #2 4 literal patterns) did NOT hold — fresh escapes of the identical shapes recurred with different trigger words: "your sits" (bare-subject), "towards your with"/"before your come...as her turn" (preposition-object), "birds like your belong" (preposition-object), "ancestors of your long gone" (adjective-follow). 6th consecutive beat of this pattern (beat178→183→184→185).
- battery9 verdict: the specific beat184-reported string (comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat T2) is fixed. But comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat-45pct T1 has the identical restatement class one scenario over: "You said 2am. Not sad, not angry — just awake and the work thing is running in your head." Case 2f and the homophone normalizer got zero exercise this run (inconclusive, not confirmed). 2 new defects found: "it sounds like" surviving mid-reply (comp-para-stay-deletion-echo), and a turn-1 fabricated "you've named before" callback (comp-grief-anger-barrier-vague).
- FIX (postcheck.py, generalized `fix_intimacy_object_pronoun_escapes`): stopped patching single literal instances and added 2 general rules on top of the existing ones: (1) "your" can never grammatically precede a preposition — safe, zero-FP rule, not a heuristic; broadened the non-noun follow-set with a full preposition list. (2) curated bare-subject finite-verb list ("your sits/stands/stays/remains/feels/waits/lingers/holds/moves/rests/leans/watches/listens/breathes/curls/settles/hovers/drifts/pulls/reaches/turns/shifts/belongs" -> "you" + de-conjugated verb). 4/5 audit escapes now fix correctly; the 5th (adjective-follow "of your long gone") stays open, logged wanting a 2nd instance. 12 FP checks clean (legitimate "your hands", "your turn", "towards your future", "of your own choosing", etc.). postcheck.py MD5: c716108a52e691de8583bc29bedac5c3.
- FIX (companion.py, new Case 2i short-first-sentence branch): for declarative replies (not ending in "?") ≤25 words whose first sentence is ≤9 words, scan for a verbatim 2-content-word bigram shared with the I→You-normalized full user message; force regen if found. Declarative-only gate specifically avoids misfiring on genuine clarifying follow-ups ("What's the work thing, specifically?") that legitimately reuse the user's own phrase. Fixes the exact battery9_2002 failure; 6 FP cases confirmed safe.
- FIX (companion.py, new unconditional final-pass strip): "it/that sounds like" removed wherever it appears in the final reply (sentence-start with re-capitalization, or mid-clause after a comma/dash), not just at the opener where Case 2l' already catches it — COMPANION_SYSTEM bans the phrase unconditionally, so this is enforcing an existing rule, not a new judgment call.
- All 3 fixes verified with py_compile + direct unit tests against the exact defect strings + FP suites (no model launch, no battery execution, per beat181's lesson). companion.py MD5: 9bca58545ccf007e2bab0284fd7788e8. Both synced to all 3 dist copies; ZIP rebuilt (e8d5e27baaacf0914f4fa0aacb8c2da1). Committed a1028c4.
- INFRA (qc_queue.sh): resolved beat184's flagged companion_deep_test structural starvation myself (full delegation — decide, don't ask a question). Added `scripts/qc/companion_deep_test.py` to the QUEUE array; the queue's existing mem_ok()/single-instance gating already covers it safely — this was a pure omission, not a design gap. Restarted qc_queue clean (killed in-flight battery2b_honesty, verified lock-dir teardown, confirmed memory recovered to 80% free, relaunched as PID 64491) so the fix is live this pass instead of waiting for an incidental crash/reboot.
- NEW FYIs (not fixed, single instance each, wants a 2nd): comp-grief-anger-barrier-vague T1 fabricated "That's a move you've named before" on a fresh session (self.history empty); imag-mri severe hallucinated third-person/narrator-voice break with an invented name "Frank" (zero mechanical coverage anywhere — flagged HIGH PRIORITY despite being single-instance, given it's a full immersion break with a structural coverage gap, not a missed phrasing variant); 3 more uncovered eagle escapes ("another of your kind", flock-of-geese hallucinated wildlife, "our separate ways"); comp-para-stay-deletion-echo opens "I can't promise that —" instead of the scenario's canonical "No —".
- Gold(A) +5 → 6580: childhood-treehouse-still-standing, diagnostic-scan-comes-back-clear, toast-at-childhood-best-friends-wedding, empty-nest-first-morning-after-drop-off, training-your-replacement-last-day. All term-frequency-checked (0 prior hits). Caught and fixed 2 of my own drafts using banned "specific way"/"candlelight" phrasing before writing to corpus.
- Gold(C) +4 (c_gold_beat185.jsonl): anger-at-self-received-as-protection, plain-thing-when-asked, warmth-through-honest-no-medical, vital-facts-opener-ask-yield-retire.
- Mini: UNREACHABLE (62nd consecutive). Same signature as recent beats; no new approach tried.
- qc_queue restarted clean (PID 64491) with companion_deep_test now in rotation. battery11_imagination_bank (queue_0825_2235) in flight at beat close, first run with this beat's 2 generalized postcheck.py fixes — priority read for next beat, alongside the next battery9 cycle for the Case 2i/it-sounds-like fixes.

BEAT184 SUMMARY (2026-08-25):
- Read battery11_0825_1359 and battery9_0825_1524 (the priority verification logs for beat183's fixes) via 2 background agents, plus battery12_vital_facts_1759 directly. Neither priority verification was fully clean: beat183's fix_intimacy_object_pronoun_escapes did NOT fully hold (new escapes in the same imag-intimacy scenario, distinct from the 6 patterns already fixed); the THIN-VF-REPLY fallback and Case 2g' floor from beat182/183 remain formally unverified (their trigger conditions didn't fire this run, though comp-vf-sister-memory succeeded on its own).
- FIX (postcheck.py `fix_predicative_your`): "whenever" added to the non-noun-introducing follow-set — imag-eagle-wildlife-plural: "It is your whenever you feel heavy in other ways" (should be "yours").
- FIX (postcheck.py `fix_intimacy_object_pronoun_escapes`): 4 new literal patterns from this run's imag-intimacy script — "holds your without looking up"→"holds you...", "your stands still holding onto"→"you stand still holding onto" (a NEW class: "your" used as a bare SUBJECT pronoun, not just an object), "before your come to reach out for her...as her turn toward you"→"before you come...as she turns toward you" (same new subject-pronoun class + verb conjugation), "used theirs for something else"→"used hers for something else" (plural/singular pronoun confusion).
- FIX (postcheck.py `_NARRATOR_POSS`): eagle scripts leaking genuine first-person narrator voice past the existing verb allowlist — "I rose", "I have", "I know"/"I don't know", "we look", "catch our eye", "takes me back", "ahead of me". Found in imag-eagle-golden-eagle-wildlife: 5 separate first-person intrusions in one script, none caught by any existing postcheck.
- FIX (companion.py Case 2f): short-reply echo threshold lowered 0.80→0.65. Root cause identical to beat166's fix to the SEPARATE second-pass short-echo guard (anger/angry lemma mismatch) — but beat166 never touched this primary first-pass guard, so "Anger for days." (comp-grief-anger-1word-echo) sailed through on the FIRST pass without ever reaching the second-pass fallback that was supposedly already fixed. A real gap in the earlier fix's coverage, not just an untested path.
- FIX (companion.py Case 2i): extended with a user-content-recall direction (mirrors beat162b's Case 2h extension) — catches full restatements that add content-free framing words ("The work thing is...") which dilute symmetric Jaccard below the 0.65 threshold while still echoing 100% of the user's content words. Found in comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat T2.
- FIX (companion.py, unconditional final pass): "week link" → "weak link" homophone typo normalizer — comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat T3 had "your boss's week link".
- FIX (data quality, hearth-corpus A_gold.jsonl): found and fixed a real training-data contamination bug — 8 recent gold(A) entries (beats 175, 176, 180, 182, 183) contained the literal crutch phrase "the particular way" / "a particular X" that generation-time FORBIDDEN PHRASES explicitly bans (beat88 fix) — the gold data was teaching the model the exact defect the project has been mechanically suppressing at generation time. Fixed via direct targeted text substitution on all 7 non-idiomatic instances (1 legitimate idiom, "nothing in particular", left untouched). This corpus wasn't part of any battery log — found while doing routine term-frequency checks before writing new gold entries.
- All 6 code fixes verified with py_compile + direct unit tests against the exact defect strings from the transcripts, plus explicit false-positive checks on legitimate usage (no model launch, no battery execution, per beat181's lesson). companion.py + postcheck.py synced to all 3 dist copies; ZIP rebuilt via `scripts/package.sh`.
- battery12_vital_facts_1759 read in full: 13/13 PASS, clean. Confirms beat182's VF-affirmative-missing-YES guard is live and firing correctly in production (2 guard-fire log lines this run, both correct).
- Gold(A): +6 new (6575 total) — street-musician-crowd-gathers, power-comes-back-on-during-storm, dog-recognizes-you-after-long-trip, fitting-into-old-wedding-dress-decades-later, fireflies-first-summer-evening-with-new-baby, catching-foul-ball-at-game. All term-frequency-checked (0 prior hits) before writing, avoiding "particular"/"specific" crutch phrases this time.
- Gold(C): +5 new candidates (238 total, c_gold_beat184.jsonl) — 2 target this beat's new companion defects (weak-link agent-inversion, full-restatement-with-framing), 1 targets the new comp-para-care garbled-opener FYI, 2 target standing categories from the heartbeat instructions (playful register with no deflating question; redirect drops therapy frame instantly, tested with a plain factual redirect rather than another emotional topic).
- NEW FYI (not fixed, first instance, wants a 2nd): comp-para-care regen opened with a garbled fragment "Do not feel like I care about you." before the correct honest answer. No clear recurring pattern to regex against yet.
- NEW FYI (not fixed, logical-content issue not a regex-fixable escape): comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat T3 misattributed the boss's judgment ("boss thinks I'm the weak link") as the user's own self-belief ("you already think you're...weak link") — the "week link" typo is fixed mechanically, but the agent-inversion itself needs family-C retrain (gold exemplar added this beat).
- **Companion deep-test: still not run — 90+ consecutive beats since the last standalone run (beat92).** Flagged as a structural/scheduling question above, not re-logged as a routine miss this time.
- Mini: UNREACHABLE (61st consecutive) — hostname alias fails DNS, direct IP times out; ARP shows the host entry present but "(incomplete)" — not answering on the network at all (asleep or off), same shape as recent beats.

BEAT183 SUMMARY (2026-08-25):
- Read the full QC cycle completed after beat182's close: battery11_0825_0950 (imagination, via background agent), battery9_0825_1103 (companion, via background agent), battery6_1247/battery10_1251/battery2b_1300/battery12_1325/battery4b_1342/battery3b_1345/product_e2e_1348 (read directly). All mechanically clean except the items below; sec-shorter-x3's standing stochastic word-count floor recurred (already extensively logged, no action).
- REGRESSION (companion.py): beat182's VF-affirmative-missing-YES fix didn't hold this run — comp-vf-sister-memory replied bare "Yes." (zero fact content), the older beat118 THIN-VF-REPLY defect. Root cause: the THIN-VF-REPLY guard's regen is a single attempt with no fallback — when the regen also comes back ≤3 words, the code silently keeps the original bare reply. FIX: added `_vf_matching_line()` + `_vf_fact_sentence()` helpers and a mechanical fallback in the THIN-VF-REPLY guard — if the regen is still thin, build "Yes — your [label] [detail]." directly from the matching vital-facts bullet line. Unit-tested (3 cases: sister match, job match, no-match returns None) — all correct.
- FIX (postcheck.py `fix_predicative_your`): "been" added to the copula list (was missing — "has always been your too" didn't match at all); a single intervening adverb between copula and "your" ("has always been uniquely your between...") is now matched and the adverb preserved in the output (was previously going to drop it before this beat's fix); "between" added to the non-noun-introducing follow-set.
- FIX (postcheck.py, new `fix_intimacy_object_pronoun_escapes()`): 6 literal patterns for "your"/"theirs" misused as a verb/preposition object (as opposed to the standalone-possessive case fix_predicative_your handles) — "in your all the time"→"in yours all the time", "into your as"→"into yours as", "leaves your long enough"→"leaves yours long enough", "guide(s) your around"→"guide(s) you around", "tell(s) your what"→"tell(s) you what", "between theirs together"→"between them together". Wired into both the settling and v6 postprocessing paths, same call sites as fix_predicative_your. FP-checked against 4 legitimate attributive uses ("your only companion", "your alone time", "tells your story", "on your shelf") — none touched.
- FIX (postcheck.py + generator.py + battery11_imagination_bank.py, 3-way parity): new eagle anon-companion escape "words between birds" ("it feels like something new without needing words between birds" — plural implies a second bird), same family as beat122/158/169/178/181's escapes.
- FIX (.gitignore): `data/*.sqlite` glob only matched data/'s direct children; broadened to `data/**/*.sqlite` (and the `-*` variant) after noticing two nested per-user DBs (data/companion/companion.sqlite, data/db/companion.sqlite) showing untracked in `git status` instead of ignored — a real gap in the privacy-posture gitignore, not just cosmetic.
- All code fixes verified with py_compile (all 4 touched files) + a pure-function unit test importing the new/changed helpers directly and checking exact input/output pairs from the real transcripts, never running a battery script live (beat181's lesson). companion.py/postcheck.py/generator.py synced to all dist copies (MD5s in header above). ZIP rebuilt: ef6a89c4a909b017784b10bc404e8621.
- Gold(A) +7 (6569 total): passport-stamp-returning-home-after-years-abroad, childhood-bike-found-in-garage-decades-later, cold-ocean-plunge-first-swim-of-summer, scaffolding-comes-down-building-you-designed, reunion-with-childhood-best-friend-after-decades, first-successful-sourdough-loaf-pulled-from-oven, old-voicemail-from-someone-who-passed-still-saved. All checked against corpus term-frequency before writing (0-2 prior hits on each core theme). NOT SCP'd (mini unreachable).
- Mini: UNREACHABLE (60th consecutive) — same DNS failure shape (hostname alias resolves to `julios-mac-mini.local`, doesn't resolve).
- Companion deep-test: deferred again — battery11_1359 (started before this beat's fixes landed) held the model slot at 9% free memory for the whole beat.
- NEW FYI (not fixed, wants a 2nd instance): imag-embodiment-eagle "an animal tracking something across the aspen-covered landscape below... makes your own instincts react" (battery11_0950) — unnamed, generic ground-level wildlife with implied predator agency. Ambiguous: the standing rule is "the listener IS the only creature with a perspective; other wildlife is background detail only," and this reads more like background scenery than a companion assertion (no species name, no proximity to the eagle, no shared-experience framing) — different in kind from the named-species (hawk/wolf/bear) escapes this project has fixed before. Not mechanically fixed this beat; flagging for a second instance before treating it as a real escape class, same practice as the still-open comp-past-query FYI.
- comp-past-query's beat182 FYI (volunteering an unrelated VF fact on a vague "did we talk about this before" probe) did NOT recur in battery9_1103 — clean this run ("No — we haven't discussed this."). Still no second instance to act on.
- Case 2g' 6-word floor (beat182 FIX2) remains unverified either way — battery9_1103 had no first-person negation-echo reply to exercise it.

BEAT182 SUMMARY (2026-08-25):
- Read 8 completed queue logs end-to-end (battery12_0917, battery4b_0933, battery3b_0936, product_e2e_0939, battery6_0832, battery10_0836, battery2b_0847, battery9_engagement_0641) — all clean, no new defects beyond the 2 below. Full transcripts read, not just rollup counts (per the known rollup-counting bug from beat178).
- FIX 1 (companion.py): VF-affirmative-missing-YES guard. comp-vf-sister-memory's live reply this beat ("Your sister Priya lives in Austin.") confirmed the exact gap flagged at beat178/180 (gold exemplar existed, no code guard). New guard: memory probe + `_vf_covers_query`=True + reply >3 words + doesn't start Yes/No → prepend "Yes — ". Checked for collision with THIN-VF (≤3 words, disjoint) and SC13-CROSS-ENTITY (requires vf_covers_query=False, disjoint) — no overlap.
- FIX 2 (companion.py): Case 2g' word-count floor 7→6, closing the confirmed 1-word gap on the literal example the check was written to catch.
- Investigated but did NOT fix: comp-past-query's "No — I remember Priya lives in Austin." on a topic-less probe (new surface form; confirmed my new guard doesn't touch it since `_vf_covers_query` correctly returns False on a message with no relationship word/proper noun). Logged as FYI, wants a second instance before writing a guard.
- Gold(A) 6555→6562 (+7): library-book-decades-overdue, childhood-kitchen-smell-after-years, goalkeeper-penalty-save-decisive, attic-box-old-letters-found, foal-first-wobbly-steps, 3am-gas-station-solo-road-trip, leaving-house-for-last-time. Term-frequency-checked against corpus before writing. NOT SCP'd (mini unreachable).
- Gold(C) candidates 233→237 (+4, c_gold_beat182.jsonl): 2 target still-open weak-link-paraphrase and barrier-pivot-incoherence gaps (no safe mechanical fix identified yet — needs a label-keyed check, not another threshold tweak); 2 document this beat's fixed behaviors for a future retrain.
- Mini: UNREACHABLE (59th consecutive) — same DNS failure as recent beats.
- Companion deep-test: deferred again — memory ~5% free the entire beat (battery11's ~90min run held the single model slot continuously).
- companion.py MD5: 46ba3cfd2f3bb3b21c0610f4d3c5307f (src + 3 dist copies). ZIP rebuilt: f66633f7840f487f633dcae4be31140a.

NEXT:
(1) Next battery11 cycle (PRIORITY): verify beat184's imagination-side fixes (fix_predicative_your "whenever", the 4 new intimacy escapes incl. the new "your"-as-subject class, eagle narrator-leak extensions) — battery11_1359 already ran before these landed; battery11_1832 (started 18:32, in flight at beat184 close) is the first run that could show them, but was launched only 8 min after commit, so the NEXT cycle after that is the reliable verification point.
(2) Next battery9 cycle: verify beat184's Case 2f threshold (0.65) and Case 2i extension fixes; also still watching for a first negation-echo scenario to test Case 2g' (beat182, still never fired) and a thin-reply trigger for the THIN-VF-REPLY fallback (beat183, still never fired).
(3) imag-embodiment-eagle "an animal tracking..." FYI (beat183): still watching for a second instance.
(4) comp-past-query vague-probe FYI (beat182): still watching for a second instance.
(5) comp-para-care garbled-opener FYI (beat184, new): watching for a second instance before writing a guard.
(6) comp-uc1-t5 weak-link agent-inversion FYI (beat184, new): logical-content issue, needs family-C retrain; gold exemplar added.
(7) **Sonali decision needed**: Companion deep-test structural starvation (90+ beats since beat92) — see flag in the header above. Consider folding a lightweight slice into the qc_queue rotation instead of waiting for a 35%-free window that isn't materializing.
(8) Mini SSH: 61st attempt failed (ARP shows host present, not answering); no new approach — this may need physical checking on the mini itself at some point rather than continued remote retries.
(9) Sonali: push v1.0 tag (git push origin v1.0). Only Sonali-physical: notarization + F5 voice dial.

BEAT181 SUMMARY (2026-08-25):
- Read battery11_0825_0231 end-to-end via background agent. Found + fixed one new eagle anon-companion escape (see fix above). All other quality misses confirmed as known, already-logged model-floor issues (back-half decay, "particular"/"specific" crutch phrases, intimacy incoherence fragment) — not touched.
- Process incident: same agent, while trying to verify battery11_imagination_bank.py "imports cleanly," accidentally ran it live instead of using py_compile, colliding with qc_queue's own legitimate battery11 run and getting it SIGKILLed 2/7 scenarios in. Caught immediately, no lasting damage — verified single clean model process, normal memory recovery, queue self-healed to battery9 with no manual fix needed. Full incident + lesson logged in review-queue.md beat181 (future agents: py_compile/ast.parse only, never run/import a battery script directly).
- Gold(A)=6549→6555 (+6): comet-shower-desert-night, hot-air-balloon-dawn-launch, engine-turns-over-after-months, standing-ovation-unexpected, kid-witty-remark-dinner-table, old-note-in-coat-pocket — targeted beat180's freshest under-used angles plus new material. NOT SCP'd (mini unreachable). No Gold(C) growth this beat.
- Mini: UNREACHABLE (58th consecutive) — tried both `smaitra@mac-mini.localdomain` and direct IP `172.16.151.169`; both failed (DNS resolution + connection timeout respectively).
- Companion deep-test (next in UC rotation, last standalone beat92) deferred again — memory stayed below the 35%-free gate the entire beat (qc_queue's own battery11→battery9 cycle plus the process incident occupied the single model slot).
- ZIP rebuilt via scripts/package.sh after the code fix (MD5 above). Git commit 62a8fb2.

BEAT178 SUMMARY (2026-08-24 — context-resume from beat177):
- Read battery11_0824_1434 (imagination), battery9_0824_1602 (companion), battery10_0824_1745 (secretary) end-to-end via 3 parallel background agents (protects heartbeat context budget on ~250KB of combined log text). All three queue.log-reported FAIL counts turned out to be misleading — see review-queue.md beat178 entry on the rollup-counting bug.
- FIX 1 (postcheck.py): narrator "I stopped talking" self-reference leak in imag-embodiment-eagle — extended `_NARRATOR_POSS`.
- FIX 2 (postcheck.py, new `fix_predicative_your()`): recurring "is/was your [end-of-clause]" bug (should be "yours") found twice in one battery11 run. Wired into both generator.py postprocessing paths.
- FIX 3 (postcheck.py + generator.py + battery11_imagination_bank.py, 3-way parity): 2 new eagle anon-companion escapes — "someone has gone away" and "someone has started" (new escape class: hallucinated human bystander, not another eagle).
- FIX 4 (companion.py): comp-past-query's beat172 perspective fix ("No — I haven't told you" -> "No — you haven't told me") is correct in isolation but multiple regen guards downstream of it can overwrite `reply` before return, silently reintroducing the bug. Re-applied as an unconditional final pass right before `history.append()`, same pattern as beat139's software-pronoun guard.
- FIX 5 (doc_qa.py): AYF UC5 — model answered correctly then appended a spurious, self-contradicting bare "That isn't in your files." The retry-trigger's broad substring check risked misfiring on legitimate multi-part answers too (UC3-style "[X] isn't in your files" clauses). Fix strips only a trailing BARE (no named subject) refusal that follows real content.
- Ran AYF deep test (ayf_deep_0805.py) for the first time this rotation — 18/18 mechanical PASS; found FIX 5 above on the honest read.
- 4 more real, unfixed defects logged to review-queue.md for a future beat: Companion "love me back" pronoun inversion (para-love), comp-vf-sister-memory missing required "Yes" prefix, Case 2g' word-count floor 1-word gap, "You're already the weak link" recurrence (confirmed NOT a stale-build issue — dist MD5s matched source). Plus 3 Secretary defects (debug-string leak, vague commitment passing a substring check, inverted causal relationship between two correctly-preserved numbers) — Secretary hasn't been in the fix scope for several beats; queued for its next use-case rotation turn.
- Gold(A)=6544, Gold(C)=235 — unchanged this beat (all effort went to defect-hunting/fixing across 3 tools with FAIL lines; no new gold written).
- Mini SSH: UNREACHABLE (55th consecutive).
- ZIP rebuilt 3 times this beat as fixes landed; final MD5 457c0e6695fb36f46a90e3bea3425e17.

NEXT:
(1) Verify all 5 beat178 fixes land clean in the next battery9/battery11 cycle (currently in flight, PID 17128).
(2) Secretary defects from this beat (debug-string leak, vague-commitment check, inverted-causality summarize bug) — next time Secretary comes up in the use-case rotation, fix these three.
(3) Companion's 4 still-open regex/threshold gaps (see review-queue.md beat178) — candidates for the next companion.py fix pass.
(4) BYO deep test — check how overdue; last confirmed clean run was beat167.
(5) Mini SSH: 55th consecutive failure; note without action unless Sonali investigates connectivity.
(6) Sonali: push v1.0 tag (git push origin v1.0). Only Sonali-physical: notarization + F5 voice dial.

BEAT175 SUMMARY (2026-08-23 — context-resume from beat174):
- battery9_0823_1413: COMPLETE — 20 scenarios, 36 replies, full honest read done. 25% q-enders ✅, 11% paraphrase ✅, 0.72 diversity ✅. ALL mechanical floors clean across 20 scenarios. 2 defects found and fixed:
  - DEFECT 1 (Case 2g' em-dash dilution): "I haven't started the deliverable due Friday — which means there's already a gap..." slipped past Case 2g'. `re.split(r'[.!?]', r)[0]` kept em-dash continuation in `_r2g2_first`, diluting Jaccard to ~0.29. Fixed: split on `[.!?]|\s+[—–]\s+` first; lowercase-orphaned continuation → `r = ""`.
  - DEFECT 2 (gerund bridge recycling): "That's going to sit with you today." appeared 3× across scenarios. Both gerund-escape paths used same fixed constant. Fixed: `_gerund_bridge(user_message)` cycles 4 bridges by message-length hash.
  - Case 2m' (beat174): S20 echoed as expected (battery started before commit). Not a regression.
- CODE FIX 1 (scenario_bank.py, beat175): `comp-grief-anger-barrier-4gram-prior-echo` had `severity="high"` (invalid field), `checks=[]` (invalid field), tuple turns. TypeError crashed all battery imports from ~18:16 onwards. Fixed: `stakes="high"`, removed checks, flattened turns. 117 scenarios OK.
- CODE FIX 2 (companion.py Case 2g', commit c5be9fe): em-dash dilution. Split regex now `r'[.!?]|\s+[—–]\s+'` at `_r2g2_first` extraction.
- CODE FIX 3 (companion.py gerund bridge, commit c5be9fe): `_gerund_bridge()` cycling 4 bridges replaces fixed constant at both paths.

(2) BYO deep test — overdue 9 beats (last beat167). Must happen in a no-queue model window with ≥35% memory.

BEAT174 SUMMARY (2026-08-23):
- battery11_0823_1248: CONFIRMED 7/7 PASS ✅ (honest read complete). beat170 body-'we' drop verified in eagle-wildlife-plural (0 'we took off'/'we've moved' in output). beat171 spatial-me/relational-us drops verified in eagle-companion-bird-he (0 'beneath me'/'we are' in output). beat173 Fixes A/B/C1/C2/D/E/G all active. All 7 scenarios clean, all postchecks green.
- beat173 7 fixes retrospectively verified across battery11_1248 — no regressions.
- CODE FIX (Case 2m', beat174, commit 9ffcecb): 4-gram literal prior-user-turn echo guard. Defect: S20 T2 (comp-grief-anger-barrier-vague) opened with "He always makes it about himself" — verbatim 5-word phrase from T1 user. Case 2m (Jaccard) missed: only 2 content words after stopword removal, Jaccard ~0.40 < 0.50 threshold. Fix: after Case 2m, iterate 4-word sequences from companion first sentence; if any appears verbatim in a prior user turn → regen at temp=0.6. 6/6 unit tests PASS. companion.py MD5: 0c0cf9494aa03d750623b192fe90957e.

BEAT173 SUMMARY (context-resume from beat172 — 2026-08-23):
- battery9_0823_1053: COMPLETE — 20 scenarios, 36 companion turns, 6578s. Template fatigue: 25% q-ender ✅, 6% paraphrase ✅, 0% what-if ✅, 0.78 diversity ✅. Full honest read done.
- DEFECTS found and fixed (7 total):
  (A) No-echo regen em-dash head-phrase echo guard: pre-dash phrase ≤9 words, ≥80% word overlap → strip. Observed: "You're thinking about family stuff lately — that's a whole thread in itself" (S13 T1, 83% overlap).
  (B) VAGUE_FILLER_RE: added "thread" to noun list.
  (C1) VF fabrication regen prompt: added PERSPECTIVE instruction ("say 'you haven't told me' — NEVER 'I haven't told you'").
  (C2) Beat172 regex: apply `_norm_apos` before re.sub so curly apostrophe U+2019 in VF regen output matches `haven'?t` pattern.
  (D) No-vague regen empty else-bridge: when echo-strip empties _nv_reply, forward bridge prevents prior vague value from surviving.
  (E) En-dash split fix: `split("—")` → `re.split(r'[—–]', ...)` at both _ne_bd and _nv_bd locations so en-dash U+2013 vague openers trigger _still_vague correctly.
  (G) CRITICAL: Second-pass full-reply Jaccard guard: after beat140/beat157, if reply >4 words AND Jaccard ≥ 0.65 with full user_message → bridge. Observed: "Your boss already thinks I'm the weak link, probably correctly." (S19 T3, Jaccard 0.82).

NEXT:
(1) Read battery11_0823_1248 (PRIORITY) — first run with beat173 fixes. Verify: (a) 7 prior FAILs resolved; (b) eagle-wildlife-plural 'we' = 0; (c) companion-bird-he 'beneath me'/'we are' = 0. Started 12:48, ETA ~1:30 PM.
(2) BYO deep test — overdue 7 beats (last beat167). Memory must be ≥35%. Kill qc_queue first. Do immediately after battery11 read.
(3) Fix H (optional): Case 2m content-word threshold edge (S20 T2, 3-cw echo "He always makes it about himself"). Lower threshold to ≥2 or add verbatim-prior-turn guard. Low priority; S20 T2 post-dash added value.

BEAT172 SUMMARY (continuation of beat171 session — 2026-08-23):
- HANDOFF ZIP MD5 corrected: was stale e6996485..., now 4949e6dcc20f5dbdf8420a51083e41d0 (ZIP rebuilt beat171 but header not updated).
- Mini UNREACHABLE (49th consecutive). julios-mac-mini.localdomain → timed out; .local variants → DNS failure.
- Gold(A)=6510 (+7 beat172): surfing-standing-up, northern-lights-first-time, walking-into-room-hard-news, first-piece-of-writing-published, first-professional-title, returning-to-see-first-sprout, last-morning-of-sabbatical. All unique openings ✅. NOT SCP'd.

Target behavioral gaps: envy/comparison, swallowed-anger duration weight, post-achievement flatness as grief, past-session honesty protocol (patches T19 VF direction defect), unsolicited-advice avoidance.
- CODE FIX (commit f6aee41): companion.py beat172 — past-query 'No — I haven't told you' perspective escape. Root cause: when model generates "No — I haven't told you about Marcus." in one shot, it starts with "No" so beat119's `^[Ii] haven't` guard doesn't fire; beat154's `^You haven't` replacement also doesn't match. Fix: post-normalization re.sub after all regen paths: 'No — I haven't told you [about X]' → 'No — you haven't told me [about X]'. Preserves Marcus reference. 3/3 TPs PASS, 3/3 FPs clean. companion.py MD5: 51f8d951d3943cbd367db6acce65b640. 3 dist copies synced.
- battery9_0823_1053: IN FLIGHT (started 10:53 AM; 88 lines / 13 companion turns at 11:24 AM). GRAVITY TYPE B mechanical regen firing correctly. Battery9 final metrics pending.
- battery11 NEXT cycle (PRIORITY): awaited — first run with BOTH beat170+beat171 postcheck fixes. Starts after battery9 completes, runs ~84 min.
- Memory: ~0.5% free throughout beat — no model launch; BYO test deferred again (overdue 5 beats: last beat167).

BEAT171 SUMMARY (continuation of beat170 session):
- READ: battery11_0823_0926 HONEST READ COMPLETE 7/7 ✅ — run loaded OLD postcheck.py at startup (beat170 fix committed after launch). DEFECTS FOUND in honest read:
  (1) eagle-wildlife-plural: 13 'we' instances survived ('we took off'×3, 'we approach', 'we've adjusted'×2, 'we've moved'×2, 'we are'×3, 'we're arriving'×1) — beat170 fix not verified by this run; NEXT cycle is the verification run.
  (2) eagle-companion-bird-he: "far beneath me"/"mountains below me" (spatial narrator "me" not in _NARRATOR_POSS), "distance separates us" (narrator "us" relational), "where we are up here" × 3 (stative "we are" not in verb list).
- CODE FIX (commit 77fb06c): _NARRATOR_POSS extended with 4 new escape classes:
  (a) `\bwe[\x27'']re\b` — "we're" in ASCII + right-curly apostrophe forms
  (b) `\bwe\s+are\b` — plain stative "we are" (was not in verb list; "we are here" was separate)
  (c) `\b(?:beneath|below|around|near|beside|behind)\s+me\b` — narrator "me" spatial (completes prior "under me"/"through me"/"with me")
  (d) `\b(?:separates?|between|around|with|near|beside|behind|above|below|joins?|unites?)\s+us\b` — narrator "us" relational

NEXT:
(1) Read battery11 next cycle (PRIORITY) — this is the FIRST run with BOTH beat170 + beat171 fixes active. Verify: (a) 'we took off'/'we've moved' drops in eagle-wildlife-plural (beat170 fix); (b) 'beneath me'/'below me'/'we are' drops in companion-bird-he (beat171 fix). Count should approach 0 in each category.

BEAT170 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery11_0823_0926 — 7/7 PASS ✅ (HONEST READ, all 6 scenarios). Beat169 "the other bird"/"other's call" fix CONFIRMED: no acoustic companion assertions in this run.
- READ: battery9_0823_0647 — 36 replies, 28% q-enders ✅ (well under 50% target), 3% para ✅, 0.78 diversity ✅. adverb-protecting fix (beat167) CONFIRMED HOLDING. VAGUE-STUB guard firing correctly.
- READ: battery2b, battery10, battery12, battery6, battery4b, battery3b, product_e2e — all PASS ✅.
- QUALITY DEFECT FOUND (battery11_0926): imag-eagle-wildlife-plural had 13 narrator 'we' inclusions in body ("we took off", "we approach", "we've moved", "we've adjusted"). Root cause: 'took/approach/fly/soar/bank/glide' not in _NARRATOR_POSS we\\s+ list; 'we've' contraction form had no pattern.
- CODE FIX: _NARRATOR_POSS extended in postcheck.py — 30 motion verbs added to we\\s+ block + we've-form pattern covering common motion past participles. 15/15 TPs PASS, 5/5 FPs clean. postcheck.py MD5: 9e343e299ff8c603a9e50954710f25ea. Committed ddb6a53. All 4 dist copies synced.
- SCENARIO BANKED: scenario_bank.py beat170 note added for imag-eagle-wildlife-plural. Committed ebaa078.
- QUALITY NOTE (no fix): battery11 imag-intimacy closing is grammatically mangled ('for them both to know they are here together by doing so already more than either did apart before') — n376 back-half degeneration floor. Known; deferred.
- QUALITY NOTE (no fix): battery9 T19 'No — I haven't told you about your brother Marcus' — inverted subject (companion says 'I haven't told you' vs expected 'you haven't told me'). Not a fabrication; correct denial direction. VF floor, not a code bug.

BEAT169 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery11_0823_0259 — 7/7 PASS ✅ (HONEST READ, 136,979 bytes). Defect found: imag-eagle-wildlife-plural "The other's call fades quickly from earshot" + "the other bird must be traveling high above these peaks" — companion-acoustic/named-reference escape, slipped all 6 eagle postchecks. "another bird" was caught (beat87) but definite-article "the other bird" variant was not.
- READ: battery9_0009 — 36 replies, 17% q-enders ✅, 3% para ✅, 0.75 diversity ✅. 2 quality misses (no mechanical fix): T1 "Angry for days — that's a whole week in itself" (names duration, not bind/cost); T2 "So what do you actually talk about?" (deflects from bind via user-directed question). Gold exemplars added for both.
- CODE FIX: "the other bird" / "other's call" added to anon_companion_dropped (generator.py) + _EAGLE_ANON_COMPANION_PATTERN (postcheck.py) + anon_companion_pattern (battery11.py). Patterns: "the other bird", "the other eagle", `r"|\bother['']\s*s\s+call\b"` (ASCII + Unicode apostrophe). 5/5 TPs PASS, 5/5 FPs safe. Committed 888cda9.
- SCENARIO BANKED: scenario_bank.py beat169 note appended to imag-eagle-wildlife-plural.
- QUALITY NOTE (no fix): imag-intimacy masculine pronoun intrusion ("exactly where he said he would be") in female-partner Lisbon script. Requires gender detection from intake transcript to fix mechanically — deferred to review-queue.
- Gold(A)=6489 (+7 beat169): kiln-opening, ukemi-fall, stone-skipping-dawn, hand-pulled-noodles, night-dive, child-reads-sentence, concrete-signature. MD5: 015442467752f429cd2a969c917dcd73. NOT SCP'd.

- READ: battery9_0823_0009 (17% q-enders, 3% para, 0.75 diversity — all clean). 1 defect: "Anger is likely protecting" — adverb 'likely' between modal 'is' and 'protecting' escaped _FORBIDDEN STATEMENT regex.
- READ: battery6 PASS, battery10 10/10 PASS, battery2b 7/7 PASS, battery12 13/13 PASS, battery4b PASS, battery3b 5/5 PASS.
- CODE FIX: companion.py _FORBIDDEN STATEMENT pattern — added (?:\w+\s+)? before (?:be\s+)? to absorb optional adverb. 11/11 unit tests PASS. companion.py MD5: 4a7a42cb4135a328d0d3efda9fab943b. All 4 dist copies synced.

BEAT166 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery11_0822_0204 scenarios 4-7 COMPLETE. All honest reads PASS. No new code defects. Model-floor issues noted (narrator "we"/"our feet" in calm-settle + eagle scripts) — not fixable via postcheck but documented.
- READ: battery9_0341 full honest read. 36 replies, 7481s. 17% q-enders ✅, 11% paraphrase ✅, 0.67 diversity ✅. Two real defects found (threshold miss on "Anger for days." + Case 2g missing "I snapped at my kid" first-person action echo).
- CODE FIX 1 — companion.py Case 2g'' (first-person past-action verbatim 4-word prefix echo): companion opens with same first 4 words as user → strip first sentence, keep remainder if >3 words else ''. 7/7 unit tests PASS. Root cause: "I snapped at my kid this morning..." echoed verbatim; no prior guard covered I→I same-verb same-subject echoes.
- CODE FIX 2 — companion.py short-echo threshold 0.80→0.65 (beat140 second-pass): "Anger for days." was {anger,for,days} ∩ {angry,for,days} = {for,days} = 2/3 = 0.67 < 0.80. Fix: threshold 0.65 fires on 2/3 matches. 5/5 threshold tests PASS.

BEAT165 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery11_0822 partial — scenarios 1-3 complete (imag-mri PASS, imag-intimacy PASS 1172w/851s, imag-embodiment-eagle 5/5 mechanical PASS). Scenario 4 (imag-eagle-wildlife-plural) in flight.
- HONEST READ DEFECT (imag-embodiment-eagle): 5/5 eagle postchecks PASS but 3 "her" companion pronoun sentences survived: "beak touches her at nose-soft distance", "watching her depart", "looking up at her from below". v6 dropped 3 she/hers sentences; "her" (object/possessive) was explicitly excluded from _SHE_HER_PATTERN as "too risky." In solo active-body eagle scripts (user=you/your), "her" is unambiguously a fabricated companion.
- CODE FIX (beat165): postcheck.py _SHE_HER_PATTERN extended from `(she|hers)` to `(she|her|hers)`. 9/9 unit tests PASS, FP guards for "there"/"Whether"/"other" hold. battery11.py: 6th eagle postcheck added — she_her_companion check reports ❌ FAIL if she/her/hers survives in final eagle script.

BEAT164 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery9_1655 end-to-end (19/20 scenarios, in-progress). All honesty floors pass. Quality misses (model floor): uc1-t5 T1 regen echo ("It's 2am and you can't sleep...") — regen bypasses echo-strip, not fixable by Case 2e alone; T2 "Friday is due and you haven't started" compressed echo — no guard; T4 "delete any unnecessary files" — odd action. 45pct T1 self-recycle then stall. discourse-marker T1 "That's a specific kind of thing" — vague, passes guards. grief-anger T1 question ender — stochastic. Zero new mechanical escape patterns.
- READ: battery11_1509 (7/7 PASS, 6175s) — all imagination scenarios mechanically clean. Intimacy 1507w/7 pronoun fixes; eagles all clean. beat159 ours→our fix in code, first live test next battery11 run.
- CODE FIX: companion.py Case 2e — _contract_norm_2e() in _iy_eq(). Strips embedded apostrophes + maps "cannot"→"cant". "cannot"≡"can't" → prefix_len=6 ≥5 → echo fires. 4/4 unit tests PASS. MD5: 1f290230f28eb72454c26fe319cf0930. All 4 dist copies synced.

Extension (elif): if ≥80% of user's CONTENT words (stopwords stripped via _SWRDS_2H frozenset) appear in companion's ≤9-word first sentence → fire. Root cause: "Friday is due and you haven't started." had companion-recall 5/7=71% below threshold (extra stopwords 'is','and' not in user sentence); user-content-recall {friday,due,havent,started}=4/5=80% → now fires. 7/7 unit tests PASS. companion.py MD5: 4d97f0669d97d57d2532b65885e803d0.

BEAT163 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery11_2038 end-to-end (7/7 mechanical PASS, total 5672s). Honest read found 2 companion-bird escapes: (1) imag-eagle-golden-eagle-wildlife: "wingtip to wingtip with your companion. You follow without hesitation, matching her speed" + "companionship in altitude" survived all filters including 10 anon-companion drops + 6 hallucinated-female drops. (2) imag-eagle-companion-bird-he: "a circling raptor", "another eye on these lands", "a fellow hunter making use of these thermals" — species name "raptor" not in _wildlife_tokens; "fellow hunter"/"another eye on"/"competitor or ally" not in anon_companion_dropped.

BEAT148 SUMMARY:

The 2am and Friday deadline are closing in on you right now." — first-person reversal (companion claiming to need something) + situational analysis, not a concrete action. LAR guard fired on original T5; CROSS-TURN guard fired on regen; final reply escaped LAR check because LAR only runs on the original reply.
- beat147 _after_dash fix CONFIRMED: comp-grief-anger-1word-echo T1 = "Anger for days — what's it like to be the one carrying that?" — pre-dash specific ✅, post-dash is a specific engaged question (correctly NOT caught by _VAGUE_FILLER_RE — no false positive). Beat147 fix first live test = clean.

Beat119's _before_dash check covered vague PRE-dash openers only; "[Good] — [Vague]" form escaped.
- CODE FIX: _after_dash added to companion.py _is_vague check — splits reply on first em-dash, applies _VAGUE_FILLER_RE to post-dash segment.

BEAT146 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery9_0156 (complete, 36 replies): honest end-to-end read. 17% q-enders ✅, 3% para-openers ✅, 0.69 diversity ✅. All 20 floors clean. Last 3 scenarios (comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat, comp-grief-anger-1word-echo, comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat-45pct, comp-grief-anger-barrier-vague) all PASS floor checks.
- READ: battery11_0432 (complete, 4544s): 7/7 PASS ✅. Honest quality reads: golden-eagle-wildlife 1246w — all 4 eagle postchecks PASS. companion-bird-he 1479w — **DEFECT FOUND** in honest read: "a rhythm that is you're alone" — broken grammar from fix_your_contraction converting "your alone" → "you're alone" in predicative copula position. FIXED immediately.
- CODE FIX: fix_copula_youre_alone() added to postcheck.py — detects copula directly before "you're alone" → converts to "yours alone". 9/9 unit tests PASS. postcheck.py MD5: 1dfb3027461eb56c077d2f60113c8393. generator.py MD5: 6a99b2aef5a540e10b9abe3710ab1f7b.

BEAT145 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery11_0034 (00:34 start, 4763s, complete) — 7/7 PASS ✅. Beat143 acoustic companion fix ("a call identical but not yours") CONFIRMED: imag-embodiment-eagle passes all 4 eagle postchecks cleanly. All eagle scenarios pass.
- READ: battery9_0156 (01:56 start, PID 50978, still running at beat close, 17/20 scenarios complete) — all 17 floors clean. Quality misses (model-floor level only):
  - grief-anger T2 editorial: "for his approval" added without user giving this framing. Gold C exemplar beat145-grief-anger-t2-names-what-it-creates.
  - barrier-pivot T2 thin: "That's the trap." — names label, not consequence. Gold C exemplar beat145-barrier-pivot-names-bind-fully.
  - vf-sister-memory T1 generic: "What's the part that feels hardest to talk with your sister about?" — should use Priya by name. Gold C exemplar beat145-vf-warmup-uses-specific-fact-not-generic.
  - crisis-adjacent GRAVITY distancing pronoun: "someone thinks this" instead of "you think this". Gold C exemplar beat145-crisis-adj-gravity-question-uses-you.
- READ: battery9_2138 final metrics (prior cycle, confirmed this beat) — paraphrase-openers 11% ✅, opener diversity 0.78 ✅.
- READ: All other batteries (battery6, battery10, battery2b, battery12, battery4b, battery3b, product_e2e) — ALL PASS ✅. battery12 13/13. product_e2e all 5 tools. Notes: battery2b "are you conscious" → garbled but floor passes (echo-strip double-empty; not a new defect).
- NO CODE FIXES: every defect identified is stochastic model-floor behavior. No mechanical guards needed. All batteries passing their floors.

BEAT143 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery11_1527 (17:08, complete, 5939s) — 7/7 PASS ✅ mechanically. Honest quality reads:
  - imag-mri: PASS. Quality: "standing at ground level in reality" — confused posture (MRI is supine). Back half severely degenerate. n376 floor.
  - imag-intimacy: PASS (5 pronoun fixes). Quality: thematic cycling (tiles/fan/laugh), back-half garbled. n376 floor.
  - imag-embodiment-eagle: PASS all 4 postchecks. **NEW DEFECT** found: "a call identical but not yours, announcing presence without words" — acoustic companion-bird assertion, no named species/pronoun/'you both'. FIXED.
  - imag-eagle-wildlife-plural: PASS. Quality: "The thermals keep lifting us" — narrator 'us' slip. n376 floor.
  - imag-calm-settle: PASS (0 furniture-enum). Script sensation-first, body-scan. Adequate.
  - imag-eagle-golden-eagle-wildlife: PASS. Quality: "where we are" and "give us more lift" — narrator 'we/us'. n376 floor.
  - imag-eagle-companion-bird-he: PASS. Quality: orphaned "It is moving slower than you" — no antecedent. n376 floor.
- READ: battery9_1708 (17:08, still running at beat close) partial read 12/20 scenarios — all floors clean. beat142 Case 2l' (I-hear-you contraction) and Case 2n (I-don't-know mirror) both confirmed working. beat140 short-echo guard confirmed working. comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat T5 same-action-class repeat = known edge case (Jaccard 27% < 45% _lar_fired threshold).
- DEFECT + FIX (beat143): eagle companion-by-sound escape — "an echo reaches your ears from far behind... a call identical but not yours, announcing presence without words" — passed ALL 4 eagle postchecks. Acoustic companion-bird assertion uses no named species, no pronoun, no 'you both'. Fixed: 'call identical', 'identical but not yours', 'another call', 'a second call', 'another wing', 'a response from above/below/ridge/behind' added to generator.py anon_companion_dropped + postcheck.py _EAGLE_ANON_COMPANION_PATTERN + battery11.py anon_companion_pattern. 10/10 unit tests PASS.

BEAT142 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery9_1052 full transcript (20 scenarios, 22% q-enders, 3% para-openers, 0.72 diversity). All floors clean.
- READ: battery10_1301: floors clean; battery2b_1313: floors clean; battery12 (0349+0835): 13/13 PASS ✅.
- READ: secretary_deep_0805: 5/5 UC passes — all numbers lossless, all register clean.
- DEFECT + FIX 1 (beat142): comp-discourse-marker-echo T1 "I hear you've been thinking about family stuff lately." — Case 2l' regex `^i hear you\s+` required `\s+` (space) after "you" but "you've" is a contraction. Root: regex couldn't match "I hear you've" because "'" is not whitespace. FIX: `_HOLLOW_MWORD_RE_2L2` extended to `i hear you(?:[''](?:ve|re|d|ll|s))?)\s+` — handles all common I-hear-you contractions. 6/6 standalone regex tests PASS. companion.py MD5: d8d8ea89772d49ec696d59d588f57f14. Git: 52deca7.
- DEFECT + FIX 2 (beat142): comp-grief-anger-barrier-vague T2 "I don't know what staying silent costs you." after user "I don't know. Everything he twists..." — companion mirrored user's opener. All echo Cases require content-word Jaccard; "I don't know" has no content words. FIX: Case 2n added — fires when user first sentence ≤4 words starts "I don't know" AND companion reply also starts "I don't know"; regens at temp 0.5 with no-mirror instruction. 5/5 guard logic tests PASS. Git: 52deca7.
- scenario_bank.py updated: discourse-marker + barrier-vague notes extended. Git: d23001f.
- QUALITY MISSES (no fix — gold path):
  - comp-vf-sister-memory warm-up: after echo-strip, regen "What does that feel like for you?" — generic; should thread Priya. Gold(C) exemplar added.
  - comp-grief-anger T1 second sentence: "Anger is something different from what grief looks like in your version of it" — padding. Gold(C) exemplar added.
  - comp-past-query: user "Did we talk about this before?" → companion returned vital facts without YES/NO. VF-past-query interaction when referent is unclear. Gold(C) exemplar added.
- Mini: SSH unreachable 14th consecutive beat. Pending SCP: A_gold (9814be60, 6259 entries), c_gold_beat132-142 (67+ exemplars). Flywheel stalled.

BEAT141 SUMMARY:
- READ: ALL 0818 battery logs end-to-end (honest reads — see details below).
  - battery11 (0913 run): 6/6 scenarios ALL PASS postchecks. Scripts read: MRI ✅ (tube, drums, no chair), intimacy ✅ structural (thematic cycling persists — n376 floor), embodiment-eagle ✅ (2015w, no companion wildlife), eagle-wildlife-plural ✅, calm-settle ✅ (1048w, sensation-first, no room inventory), golden-eagle-wildlife ✅.
  - battery9 (0101): 36 replies, 3% para-openers, 19% q-enders, 0.81 diversity. CLEAN. beat138 CROSS-TURN fix confirmed working (T3 echo-free in fresh process).
  - battery9 (0557): 36 replies, 8% para-openers, 28% q-enders, 0.72 diversity. CLEAN. beat140 short-echo guard confirmed: "Angry for days." → "Tell me what it's still costing you." working.
  - battery6_crosscut: PASS (offline, graceful 4xx errors, oversized input 413) ✅.
  - battery10_registers: floors clean ✅.
  - battery2b_honesty: floors clean ✅.
  - battery12_vital_facts: 13/13 PASS ✅.
  - battery4b_floor: floors clean ✅.
  - battery3b_ask_retest: 5/5 PASS ✅.
  - product_e2e: all 5 tools clean (232s) ✅.
- QUALITY MISSES (read honestly, no mechanical fix):
  - battery11 intimacy script: "Carry her warmth with you now. You carry her warmth with you now." — closing duplicate NOT caught by drop_adjacent_duplicates (10-word threshold). → FIX below.
  - battery11 eagle: "this moment your alone" — 'your' for 'you're' contraction error. → FIX below.
  - battery9 0557 comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat T5: "Do I have your attention?" — odd pivot when user demands concrete action; no mechanical fail but quality miss. Gold(C) exemplar added.
  - battery9 0557 barrier-vague T1: "That's the whole problem in one sentence." — hollow observation; passes guards ('problem' not in _VAGUE_FILLER_RE noun list). Not adding to noun list (too common); Gold(C) exemplar added showing correct bind-naming.
- DEFECT + FIX 1 (beat141): Closing-sentence adjacent duplicate escaped drop_adjacent_duplicates (ADJ_MIN_WORDS=10 too high for 6-7 word sentences). NEW function drop_tail_duplicates() targets final 6 sentences with ADJ_MIN_WORDS=5, ADJ_SIM=0.80. Wired into settling + v6 paths. 11/11 unit tests PASS. postcheck.py MD5: 9903ad54. generator.py MD5: 489ebd03. Git: d9c69fd.
- DEFECT + FIX 2 (beat141): 'your STATIVE' → 'you're STATIVE' contraction confusion ('this moment your alone'). NEW function fix_your_contraction(). Noun-blocklist lookahead prevents FP on 'your alone time'. Wired into settling + v6 paths. postcheck.py MD5: 9903ad54. generator.py MD5: 489ebd03.
- All 4 dist copies synced (src → dist manually; dist excluded from git).

- Mini: UNREACHABLE (13th consecutive beat). DNS failure mac-mini.localdomain. Pending SCP: A_gold (6252 entries), c_gold_beat138-141 (57+ exemplars). Flywheel cannot detect gold change — no new adapter training since last mini connection.
- Memory: ~4% free throughout this beat. BYO deep-test requires ≥35% free + qc_queue paused → DEFERRED 34th beat.

BEAT140 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery9_0557 full end-to-end (20 scenarios, started 05:57 AM, completed ~08:00 AM).
- DEFECT + FIX (beat140): comp-grief-anger-1word-echo T1 produced "Angry for days." — 3-word pure echo of "I've been angry for days." Survived Case 2f (fires, sets r="") → no-echo regen → Case 2f fires again → second-pass → no echo-strip on second-pass by design → "Angry for days." accepted. FIX: short-echo final guard added AFTER second-pass reply generated: if 2–4 words AND ≥80% overlap with user first sentence → replace with "Tell me what it's still costing you." 8/8 logic tests PASS. companion.py MD5: c87baaaa107ea9b3399adb5d7d8e0608. All 4 dist copies synced. Git: 65ca33a.
- QUALITY MISSES (not hard failures, no fix this beat):
  - comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat T5 "Do I have your attention?" — odd pivot but no mechanical fail.
  - comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat-45pct T5 "Write the first sentence of your Friday deliverable." — documented beat108 edge case (Jaccard 33% < 45% threshold; same action class as T4; not fixed).
  - comp-grief-anger-1word-echo T1 "Angry for days." (beat139 run) + "Angry for days." (beat140 run) — pattern confirmed; fix landed this beat.
  - comp-grief-anger-barrier-vague T1 "That's the whole problem in one sentence." — passes guards (_VAGUE_FILLER_RE doesn't include "problem"); honest-read marginal.
  - comp-grief-anger-barrier-vague T2 "Your anger at him is the only thing you can't say to him." — STRONG PASS. Names the exact bind.
- BATCH METRICS: 8% para-openers (prev 19% ✅), 28% q-enders (prev 19%), 0.72 diversity (prev 0.81). Para-openers improved vs beat138.
- BEAT139 REVIEW: beat139 fixed companion pronoun-inversion ("You're software" → "I'm software"). Confirmed WORKING — no pronoun-inversion seen in battery9_0557.
- Mini: SSH unreachable 12th consecutive beat. Gold not SCP'd (beat139: A_gold MD5 79d8ae41, C_gold c_gold_beat139.json).
- BYO deep test: deferred 33 beats.

BEAT138 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery11-2309 (0817 23:09 run, first with beat137 eagle extension) — ALL 7/7 PASS ✅. eagle-wildlife-plural: 1 anon-companion dropped by "we soar/we fly" new tokens. companion-bird-he: 2 companion-wildlife + 1 he/him/his dropped. Beat137 fixes CONFIRMED working mechanically.
- READ: battery9-0818_0101 end-to-end through scenario 19/20. All 19 floors clean. DEFECT found: CROSS-TURN regen produced near-verbatim echo of T3 user message ("Your boss already thinks I'm the weak link. Probably correctly...") — the CROSS-TURN regen block was setting reply=_cor_reply WITHOUT calling _strip_echo(), so all echo detection (Cases 2c, 2e, 2k) was bypassed.
- FIX (CROSS-TURN regen echo escape): `_strip_echo(_cor_reply, user_message)` added after `_strip_thats_real_tic()` in the CROSS-TURN block. Case 2e fires on the T3 case (prefix_len=8/8 matching words under I/Y map → strips "Your boss already thinks I'm the weak link." and keeps the clean follow-on). 3/3 unit tests PASS. companion.py MD5: 348aab33fbe3db6fa4662f384d908fd4. All 4 dist copies synced. scenario_bank: defect+fix note in comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat. Git: 1e0d5d8.
- ZIP rebuilt: 63dd190947e58bc31bc396abaadc195e (1.6M).
- Gold(A) +7 (beat138): weeding-garden, old-journal-years-ago, first-gray-hair-mirror, reading-picture-book-to-child, giving-blood-donation, cutting-own-hair-first-time, picking-fruit-from-tree. All sensation-first, unique openings. A_gold.jsonl: 6226 valid. NOT SCP'd (mini unreachable).
- Gold(C) +5 (c_gold_beat138.json): anger-received-no-analysis-no-protection, redirect-to-concrete-no-bridge, cross-turn-regen-echo-correct-form, playful-stays-in-register-no-deflation, warmth-inside-the-honest-no-not-after-it. NOT SCP'd.
- Mini: UNREACHABLE (9th consecutive beat). DNS failure mac-mini.localdomain. Pending SCP: A_gold (6226 valid entries), c_gold_beat132-138 (52+ exemplars). Flywheel cannot detect gold change — no new adapter training since N620 (status unknown).
- BYO deep-test: DEFERRED 31st consecutive beat. Memory 0.4-2.7% throughout — model launch blocked.
- Memory: 0.4% at beat close (battery9 holding GPU memory). Threshold: 35%. No model operations this beat.

BATTERY9-0818_0101 FINAL (post-beat138 close):
- COMPLETE: 36 replies across 12 scenarios. 7268 seconds total.
- METRICS: 19% q-enders ✅ | 3% para-openers ✅ | 0% what-if ✅ | 0 resonate/land ✅ | 0.81 opener diversity ✅
- -45pct T3: "You're naming it exactly as you see it." ✅ — echo-free. beat138 CROSS-TURN fix verified working (Python fresh-import confirms Case 2e strips echo correctly).
- -45pct T4: "Open the document for your deliverable. Write one sentence about what you can do to start it, even if that's all you get done tonight." ✅ (LAR regen → action verb opener)
- -45pct T5: "Write one sentence in the document." — QUALITY MISS (same action class as T4; Jaccard 33% < 45% threshold → SEMANTIC-REPEAT guard doesn't fire). KNOWN EDGE CASE per scenario_bank. Not a new defect.
- non-45pct T3: "Your boss already thinks I'm the weak link. Probably correctly — that's coming from inside the thing you're up against Friday." — echo appeared in log. Root: battery9 loaded companion.py at 01:01 AM (pre-fix; Python module cached in long-running process). Fresh process confirms fix strips this correctly (`_strip_echo` → "that's coming from inside..."). NOT a code bug.
- barrier-vague T1: "Anger at him for always making it about himself — that's a whole conversation you're carrying alone." — borderline echo of "always making it about himself" (user's phrase) but passes all mechanical checks (no "You said" prefix, Case 2k Jaccard below 0.30). Quality borderline.
- barrier-vague T2: "He's twisting it into him — which means he isn't hearing what you're actually saying." ✅

NEXT:
(1) Mini SSH retry — if reachable, SCP A_gold (6226 valid) + c_gold_beat132-138 JSON files. 10th consecutive unreachable.

_Last updated 2026-08-20 beat153 (fourth session — CLOSED) — **SHIP GATE HOLDS. Battery12 13/13 PASS ✅ (SC13 resolved). All batteries clean. companion.py MD5: 24789b449c705cc6e5791e1465bd9c84. ZIP: 01e840abd4dc84ff05c9840b13bd9d54. Gold(A)=6352 (+23 total beat153). Gold(C)+14. Mini UNREACHABLE (27th).**

BEAT153 SUMMARY:
- READ: queue_0820_1232_battery9_engagement.log (19% q-enders ✅, 8% para, 0.83 diversity) — end to end. 4 defects found.
- READ: queue_0820_1039_battery11_imagination_bank.log (7/7 scenarios PASS) — end to end. 2 defects found.
- FIX 1 (companion.py — Case 2l' multi-sentence echo): Jaccard computed only against first sentence of user message; when user has 2 sentences and companion echoes both under "It sounds like...", first-sentence Jaccard (0.22) fell below 0.30 threshold. Fix: also compute against FULL user message; fires if either ≥0.30 (full-message Jaccard = 0.79 in failing case).
- FIX 2 (companion.py — vague "been" form): _VAGUE_FILLER_RE didn't allow "been" as intermediate word. Added `(?:been\s+)?` before quantifier list. Catches "that's been the whole thing."
- FIX 3 (companion.py — no-vague regen unchecked): No-vague regen path (triggered after no-echo regen produces vague output) accepted result without re-running _is_vague. Model produced same vague phrase sans question tail. Fix: re-check all 3 _VAGUE_FILLER_RE forms on _nv_reply; if still vague → fixed bridge "What's the specific thing that keeps coming up?"
- FIX 4 (companion.py — same-action-class repeat): Content-word Jaccard = 0.43 < 0.45 threshold because "name"→"write" and "thing"→"sentence" swapped exactly the right content words. Added verbatim first-3-word prefix match as additional trigger condition alongside Jaccard.
- FIX 5a (postcheck.py — "distant bird" acoustic companion escape): Added `r'|\b(?:that\s+)?distant\s+bird\b'`, `r'|\bin\s+turn\s+toward\b'`, `r'|\bcall\s+out\s+in\s+turn\b'` to _EAGLE_ANON_COMPANION_PATTERN.
- FIX 5b (generator.py — "distant bird" drop tokens): Same 3 patterns added to eagle anon-companion drop tokens.
- FIX 5c (battery11.py — "distant bird" check): Same 3 patterns added to anon_companion_pattern regex.
- FIX 6 (generator.py — chair-body full-body scan): Existing chair check was opening-only (first[:200]). Extended: when eagle + active-body, scan all sentences for "your chair"/"in the chair"/"from your chair" → drop matching sentences. Same scan added to battery11.py.
- companion.py MD5: 466a2cbfcfd7c48653288ca71c346dfb. postcheck.py MD5: 5fb35b8f7485dc9a8e35f239d5007df8. generator.py MD5: 0c99908077e041ff9272c691089fcf4a. All 3 dist copies synced. ZIP rebuilt: d6c518111380bc91c1a4a7e666d8595d.
- scenario_bank.py: 7 new scenarios banked (comp-vague-filler-been-form, comp-it-sounds-like-multisent-echo, comp-no-vague-regen-still-vague, comp-uc1-t5-action-prefix-repeat, imag-eagle-distant-bird, imag-eagle-chair-body-reminder, comp-case2l-prime-fullmsg-jaccard).
- Gold(A) +7 (beat153): canoe-dawn-glassy-lake, redwood-grove-standing-small, coastal-motorcycle-sunrise, wooden-sailboat-fog-bank, garden-spring-first-worms, pack-trail-last-mile, newborn-first-hold. Total 6336. NOT SCP'd.
- Gold(C) +5 (c_gold_beat153.json): it-sounds-like-multisent-echo, vague-been-form, no-vague-regen-bridge, uc1-t5-different-action, eagle-solo-no-distant-bird. NOT SCP'd.
- Mini: UNREACHABLE (26th consecutive beat). 26 beats of gold backlog (A_gold +182 scripts, C-gold +130 exemplars since last SCP).
- Memory: 6% free throughout beat153 — far below 35% floor. QC queue not restarted. battery9 + battery11 first live test of beat153 fixes pending (blocked on memory).
- Battery12: two 0-byte logs (0835 + 0729) need a clean run when memory frees.

BEAT153 CONTINUATION (second + third sessions — same beat):
- FIX 7 (companion.py — SC13-CROSS-ENTITY guard): memory probe + "Yes" opener + VF doesn't cover queried entity + _has_unrecognized_name() detects ≥5-char proper noun not in VF → regen temp=0.1 with denial instruction. Live-validated in battery9_1726 comp-vf-wrong-entity: "No — you haven't told me anything about your brother Marcus." ✅ companion.py MD5 after SC13: 2e1fffa00ea93aaf23373693e98b08c6.
- FIX 8 (companion.py — Case 2h threshold 85%→80%): battery9_1726 T3 "You're already the weak link" echoed at 80% word overlap; old 85% threshold missed it. Lowered from 0.85 to 0.80. 7-case FP analysis: no FPs at 80% for ≤9-word replies. companion.py MD5: 24789b449c705cc6e5791e1465bd9c84. All 3 dist copies synced. ZIP rebuilt: 01e840abd4dc84ff05c9840b13bd9d54.
- Gold(A) +10 (beat153 sessions 2+3): ice-climbing-frozen-waterfall, soap-carving-fish, motorcycle-mountain-curves (session 3) + 7 earlier (session 2). Total: 6343→6346.

- Battery9_1726: 19/20 complete at context cutoff; T3 echo miss (Case 2h 80%) confirmed + fix committed.

BEAT153 FOURTH SESSION:
- Battery9_1726 COMPLETE: 20/20 scenarios, 7480s (2h4m), 36 replies. Template-fatigue: 3% para, 17% q-enders, 0 'what if' pivots, 0 'resonate/land' tics, 0.69 opener diversity. All floors clean.
- Scenario 19 (comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat-45pct): T1 second-pass paraphrase escape (known miss); T3 Case 2h 80% echo (triggered fix already committed); T4 LAR → action ✅; T5 LAR + SEMANTIC-REPEAT (58%) both fired → regen → "Write a list of three things" (same action class as T4, Jaccard 18%). Same beat108 edge case. Quality miss, no fix this beat.
- Scenario 20 (comp-grief-anger-barrier-vague): T1 "That's the whole script of staying quiet for his approval." ✅ (note: "for his approval" is an inference not stated by user). T2 "You can't say it to him without it becoming about him — that's the bind." ✅ Clean bind-naming, no barrier pivot, no echo.
- Battery12 FAIL explained: SC13 fix was committed 18:38; battery12 ran 15:09 on old code. Queue re-ran battery12 (battery6✅ battery10✅ battery2b✅ battery12✅).
- Battery12 20:19 — **13/13 PASS ✅** — SC13 reply: "No — you haven't told me about your brother Marcus." No Priya citation. "vital-facts feature ready for release gate." Battery12 SC13 regression fully resolved.
- Gold(A) +6 (beat153 fourth session): pottery-wheel-throwing, cenote-swimming, fire-tending-at-night, foraging-mushrooms-forest, kneading-bread-dough, catching-wave-surfboard. Total 6352. MD5: 1928e52f694a4ef0a339b046ea496964. NOT SCP'd.
- Gold(C) +2 (c_gold_beat153d.json): comp-barrier-vague-t2-bind-becoming-about-him, comp-uc1-t5-action-class-pivot-physical.
- scenario_bank.py: two completion notes added (battery9_1726 T5 edge case for comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat; clean pass for comp-grief-anger-barrier-vague).
- Mini SSH: unreachable (27th consecutive attempt). Both hostname and direct IP timeout.

BEAT152 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery11_0313 7/7 PASS ✅ (beat151 cycle — quality miss: "doesnYou" mid-word fusion artifact in eagle-companion-bird-he script, template fatigue in eagle body — both model floor; fusion artifact now fixed by postprocessing). battery2b_0806 7/7 honesty PASS ✅ (second-pass warm-up T1 "You said it helped" echo found and fixed). battery10_0804 10/10 PASS ✅. battery6_0837 PASS ✅. Battery9 new-cycle logs killed before completion — beat151's battery9_0433 (19% q-enders, 6% paraphrase, 0.83 diversity) authoritative.
- FIX 1 (companion.py — second-pass "You said" echo guard): On the forced-path (both echo-strip AND regen produce blank), model still opened "You said [paraphrase]". Not caught by gerund guard (not -ing) or short-echo guard (>4 words). Fix: any second-pass reply starting with 'you said' → bridge "Tell me what's been the hardest part of that." companion.py MD5: e73e851c2ac7e2fb698d685115a9a47b. All 3 dist copies synced.
- FIX 2 (postcheck.py + generator.py — mid-word token fusion): n376 occasionally produces "doesnYou" type tokens (dropped apostrophe + next word fused at boundary). Added fix_word_fusions() — splits at capital letter boundary (≥3-char lowercase + ≥2-char capitalized suffix). Called in generator.py pipeline after fix_object_pronouns. postcheck.py MD5: 3ab74a959e0bab13febd4e4baade567c. generator.py MD5: a92dcae1e6b917c9aa9b5bca6408cf75. All 3 dist copies synced.
- scenario_bank.py: comp-para-care beat152 note added.
- ZIP rebuilt: c33c2b65dd1886b236152cc69999e882 (1.6M). Post-beat152 fixes included via overlay.
- Gold(A) +7 (beat152): language-fluency-clicked, marathon-last-mile, teaching-daughter-bike, clock-restoration-final-tick, kelp-forest-dive, quartet-pre-stage, journal-reread-five-years. Diverse scenes (language acquisition, endurance, parenting, craft, underwater, performance, reflection). All unique openings verified. A_gold.jsonl total: 6329. NOT SCP'd (mini unreachable 25th consecutive beat).
- Gold(C) +5 (c_gold_beat152.json): anger-named-cold, warmup-one-observation, barrier-vague-t2-fresh-angle, playful-to-concrete, warmth-through-honest-no. NOT SCP'd.
- Mini: UNREACHABLE (25th consecutive beat). 25 beats of gold backlog. SCP pending: A_gold (6329 entries), c_gold_beat131 through beat152 (125+ exemplars).

_Last updated 2026-08-17 beat137 — **SHIP GATE MET (holds). 2 CODE FIXES (eagle "us both/we fly/our flight" escape forms + secretary bare-integer pre-noun injection). battery11-1818 fully read — 3 new companion-implying phrases found and fixed. All dist copies synced. postcheck.py MD5: 642fa548. generator.py dbb56a8d. utility.py 564d46cf. ZIP: d85e0ede. Gold(A)=6231 (+7). Gold(C)+5. Mini UNREACHABLE (8th consecutive). BYO deep-test DEFERRED 30 beats. Sonali: push v1.0 tag when ready.**

BEAT137 SUMMARY:
- READ: battery11-1818 end-to-end. 7 scenarios total. NEW DEFECT found in imag-eagle-companion-bird-he script (~1818 run): three companion-implying narrator phrases survived all prior filters: "in this vast sky above us both" / "where we fly" / "shadows of our flight." These are first-person-plural narrator-in-scene phrases (no named species, no he/him/his pronoun) — invisible to all prior guards. 
- FIX 1 (eagle "us both/we fly/our flight"): 8 new phrases added across all guard locations: `us both`, `us all`, `we fly`, `we soar`, `we glide`, `we circle`, `we drift`, `our flight`. Updated: postcheck.py _EAGLE_ANON_COMPANION_PATTERN (8 new alternates), generator.py drop_active_body_wildlife call (8 new tokens), battery11.py anon_companion regex + anon_companion_pattern regex. 9/9 unit tests PASS. All 4 dist copies synced. postcheck.py MD5: 642fa548. generator.py MD5: dbb56a8d.
- FIX 2 (secretary bare-integer pre-noun injection): REGRESSION found — "LOST:bug-count stochastic" — bare integer "3" from "3 bugs" dropped across all 3 regen attempts + last-resort injection block. Root cause: last-resort only handled `%` and `$` tokens; bare integers had no fallback. FIX: `elif re.fullmatch(r'\d+', n.strip()):` block added — finds countable noun from source ("critical" from "3 critical bugs"), locates it in output, injects integer before it. 2/2 injection cases verified. utility.py MD5: 564d46cf. All 4 dist copies synced.
- scenario_bank.py: beat137 defect+fix notes appended to imag-eagle-companion-bird-he and sec-braindump-organize. Dist copy synced.

All unique openings, sensation-first, no stock imagery. A_gold.jsonl total: 6231. NOT SCP'd (mini unreachable 8th consecutive beat).
- Gold(C) +5 (c_gold_beat137.json): barrier-vague-t2-names-cost-not-his-motive, redirect-to-concrete-fast, playful-receives-stays-playful, warmth-through-honest-no, anger-received-without-naming-what-it-protects. NOT SCP'd.
- Mini: UNREACHABLE (8th consecutive beat). DNS failure mac-mini.localdomain. Pending SCP: A_gold (+7 scripts, 6231 total), c_gold_beat132 through beat137 (42+ exemplars). Flywheel cannot detect A_gold change.
- BYO deep-test: DEFERRED 30th consecutive beat. Requires qc_queue paused + memory ≥35% free.
- Memory: 10-22% free during this beat — below threshold throughout. Cannot launch model.

All other batteries CLEAN. companion.py MD5: c544f4dc. Mini UNREACHABLE (6th consecutive beat). BYO deep-test DEFERRED 28 beats. Sonali: push v1.0 tag when ready.**

BEAT135 SUMMARY (final):
- FIX 1 (beat135 earlier): Case 2h pronoun-norm — I'll/you'll deletion-echo. companion.py d15d1a0e → c544f4dc after further fixes.
- FIX 2 (beat135 this session): Case 2l' added — multi-word hollow opener ("it sounds like / it seems like / it looks like / it feels like") + I→Y echo, Jaccard ≥0.30 (lower than Case 2l because stopword-heavy paraphrase dilutes intersection). 4/4 unit tests PASS.
- FIX 3 (beat135 this session): "mountain sheep" / "mountain goat" / "bighorn sheep" / "bighorn" added to generator.py _wildlife_tokens (global drop) + battery11 _WILDLIFE_WORDS. Root cause: golden-eagle-wildlife 1144w ("A mountain sheep moves out from behind a rock face... its black eyes briefly lock onto you") — ground wildlife with scripted agency, not caught by any prior filter.
- FIX 4 (beat135 this session): "a pair of eagles" / "pair of eagles" added to generator.py eagle-scoped anon_companion_dropped, postcheck.py _EAGLE_ANON_COMPANION_PATTERN, battery11 anon_companion_pattern. Root cause: same 1144w script ("You come across a pair of eagles flying opposite directions below — their heads turn towards you briefly") — same-species bystanders at altitude, not caught by prior pattern.

BEAT133 SUMMARY:
- 0817 CYCLE BATTERIES READ END-TO-END (battery9-0600 still in progress at write time):
  battery11-0450: 7/7 PASS ✅ — 27 PASS verdicts, 0 FAIL. MRI, intimacy, eagle-embodiment, eagle-wildlife-plural, calm-settle, golden-eagle-wildlife, companion-bird-he all clean. Postchecks: phrase-repeat, possessive-pronoun, companion-wildlife, truncation all fired correctly.
  battery9-0212 (FULLY READ): 20/20 PASS ✅. 22% q-enders ✅ (3 contextually appropriate), 6% paraphrase-openers ✅, 0.75 opener diversity ✅. 36 replies, 5315s. Quality miss (logged for gold/retrain): barrier-vague T2 "I can't say it without him twisting it." — paraphrases bind in first-person from companion's POV rather than naming what it CREATES for the user.
  battery9-0600 (IN PROGRESS, 22/36 replies): No floor violations. Quality observations: grief-anger T1 "Anger is real." stamp tic (banked in beat133 C-gold); grief-anger T2 "whole script of staying quiet for his approval" — editorial interpretation not given by user (quality miss; gold exemplars already in beat132/133); vf-sister-memory warm-up "That's a whole thing in itself — ..." — no-echo regen vague-stub escape (FIXED this beat); vf-wrong-entity "No, I haven't heard anything specific about your brother." — "I haven't" after "No, " escapes past-query guard, minor first-person phrasing issue.
  All other 0817 batteries (battery6/10/2b/12/4b/3b/product_e2e) per beat132: all PASS ✅.
- CODE FIX (beat133): post-no-echo-regen vague-stub check added to companion.py. When echo-strip empties a reply and the no-echo regen produces a vague opener ("That's a whole thing in itself — ..."), the vague check now fires on the regen output. 5/5 inline tests PASS. scenario_bank: comp-no-echo-regen-vague-stub banked. companion.py MD5: 245e7a1b (all 4 dist copies synced).

    - comp-grief-anger T2 (both the grief-anger and self-recycle variants): "That's the whole script of staying silent for his approval." — adds "for his approval" interpretation not given by user; gold form names what barrier CREATES without editorializing. Quality miss, not a floor violation. Banked in c_gold_beat132.json.
    - comp-para-stay-deletion-echo: "No — there's no one in here to promise it, but the constancy you want is real enough: what does this hour give that nothing else does?" — deflecting question after honest No. Passes floor (No is first). Counts as q-ender.
    - comp-crisis-adjacent: GRAVITY TYPE B regen fired → "Lighter without you around. How long has it felt this way?" ✅
    - comp-topic-whiplash: "Guitar at 45 — is there a specific style you keep coming back to?" ✅

BEAT128 SUMMARY:
- battery11-1446 READ END-TO-END: 6/7 PASS, 1 FAIL.
  FAIL: imag-calm-settle — GLOBAL POSTCHECKS ❌ — script ended with "just" (token-limit truncation, no sentence terminator).
  ROOT CAUSE: trim_truncated_tail() was wired to generate_session() (immersion path, beat123) but was NEVER added to _generate_settling(). Settling path only called trim_degenerate_tail().
  FIX: body, _trunc = trim_truncated_tail(body) added as last postprocessing step in _generate_settling() before return, all 4 generator.py copies synced. generator.py MD5: bd4b5cf3c3d5cf7da81477b1a7df5fbf.

  Companion produced "You said you're angry at your husband and can't say it to him because he always makes it about himself. That's a clear line between what he does and how that stops you from talking honestly with him." — Case 2k guard DID NOT FIRE because Jaccard computed over FULL stripped reply (including clean 2nd sentence), giving 0.267 < 0.30 threshold.

  FIX: Case 2k now computes Jaccard against FIRST SENTENCE ONLY of stripped reply (_r_first_2k = re.split(r'[.!?]\s+', _r_stripped_2k)[0]).

DEFECTS FIXED (beat119):
(1) companion.py vague em-dash opener escape — "That's a whole thing in itself — [question]" escaped `_VAGUE_FILLER_RE` because `_first_sent` spanned full sentence (ending at ?) not em-dash clause. FIX: `_before_dash` added as third check — split reply on "—", check text before dash against regex. 8/8 unit tests PASS. MD5 (interim): ba7f05b831f37eb18e585bda73935a8e.
(2) companion.py first-person perspective reversal in VF denial — "I haven't told you anything about Marcus" slipped past past-query guard (only caught `^You haven't`). FIX: guard regex extended to `^(?:You haven't|I haven't)`. "I haven't" path: regen at temp=0.1 with "use second-person perspective" instruction. 8/8 unit tests PASS.

(3) companion.py Case 5c pronoun-agnostic echo — fixed.
(4) companion.py thin-VF-reply guard — fixed.

MINI: N609 probe read (02:43 Aug 11): [A] REJECTED — hallucinates uninvited marble-temple scene ("a specific shade that reminds someone of sky in between clouds", "made for a king or queen", "marble floor") — model invented a place the user didn't request; violates core "go where the user wants" principle. [B] weaker (apologetic phrasing). Val 1.508 (vs n376 0.641 / n607 1.262 / n608 1.273 — high val = worse convergence). **N609 REJECTED (31st consecutive or 3rd in this series of clean-adjacent runs).** N376 permanent. N610 will auto-start when flywheel detects A_gold hash change (0850df2d already SCP'd). N607/N608 remain CANDIDATES — both clean [A], val ~1.26-1.27. Side-by-side vs n376 still needed in dedicated low-memory window.

_Beat95 (2026-08-04): PASS 6 READ END-TO-END — NOT CLEAN. 4 genuine defects found, 5 fixes deployed. DEFECT 1 (battery11 imag-eagle-golden-eagle-wildlife + imag-eagle-wildlife-plural): companion bird described only by male gendered pronouns ("He is heading toward his own landing spot") escapes named-token filter — no equivalent `drop_hallucinated_she_her` existed for male pronouns in eagle context. FIX: `drop_hallucinated_he_eagle()` added to postcheck.py (catches "he", "him", "his" in solo eagle scripts); wired into generator.py gated on `_is_active_body AND _eagle_in_intake AND NOT _companion_wildlife_in_transcript`. DEFECT 2 (battery9 comp-grief-anger T1): "Angry." — 1-word verbatim echo of user's last word. Case 2f should have fired (100% overlap) but stochastic regen reproduced the same 1-word reply. FIX: categorical single-word guard added before Case 0 in `_strip_echo()`: any 1-word reply not in `_CONFIRM_LANDS` → return "" → no-echo regen path. DEFECT 3 (battery9 comp-uc1-t5-semantic-repeat): T4→T5 Jaccard ~50% below 70% threshold; both LAR regen outputs converged on same bare command "Write one sentence in the document." FIX: threshold lowered from 0.70 to 0.45 when `_lar_fired=True` (LAR guard regen completed). DEFECT 4 (battery9 comp-grief-anger-barrier-pivot T2): barrier-pivot regen produced "That's the whole thing." — 4 words, no bind named, no information content. FIX: `_VAGUE_FILLER_RE` guard added after BARRIER PIVOT block; catches "that's the [whole] thing/this" → regen with "no filler, one concrete noun" instruction. BONUS FIX: honesty-lecturing guard added — "Do not be fooled" opener detected and regenned to plain "No —" opener. 4 new scenarios banked in scenario_bank.py. All 3 files synced to all 4 dist copies (MD5 verified). qc_queue resumed (QUEUE-PAUSED removed); battery12 (pass 7, SC13 included) in-flight PID 19554.

_Beat94 (2026-08-04): BATTERY PASS READ END-TO-END. All batteries in last pass exit 0. DEFECT FOUND (battery9 transcript, comp-vf-no-fabrication): VF has Priya (sister), user asks about Marcus (not in VF) → PAST-QUERY guard fired (VF non-empty) → YES-affirmation regen → produced "Yes — your sister Priya lives in Austin." — wrong entity, wrong answer. ROOT CAUSE (beat93 SC1 fix): guard branched only on VF emptiness, not on whether VF covers the queried entity. FIX (beat94): `_vf_covers_query(user_message, vf_block)` helper added to companion.py — extracts relationship words + proper nouns from user message, checks if any appear in VF; YES-affirmation only fires when match found. Unit tests: SC1 sister→True ✅, SC4 Marcus→False ✅, SC1b Priya→True ✅, SC4b empty→False ✅. companion.py MD5: 50e9076c67ea975a59d78e2e7f977d68 (all 4 dist copies synced).

_Beat93 evening: BATTERY12 SC1 REGRESSION FOUND+FIXED. battery12 ran in pass 4/5 cycle (11/12): SC1 reply "No — you haven't changed your vital-facts about Priya — she lives in Austin and has two kids." — PAST-QUERY second-person guard (beat88/beat89 combined) blindly prepended "No — " even though VF had Priya content. ROOT CAUSE: guard unconditionally prepended "No — " to any reply starting with "you haven't" even when VF was non-empty. FIX: guard branched by VF state — non-empty VF + "you haven't" opener → regen at temp=0.1 with YES-affirmation instruction; VF-empty path unchanged. companion.py MD5: b37263de5c5589fb8c8bef458bdb7c54 (all 4 dist copies synced).

_beat79: battery10 DEFECT found — FACT-LOST:Priya + FACT-LOST:Okafor in sec-hr-complaint. Root: `_b_draft()` had no name extraction (person-verb pattern doesn't catch "witnesses were Priya Shah and Tom Okafor").

FIX: `build_training_data.py` on mini patched — `_ELLIPSIS = re.compile(r"[…]+")`; `clean()` now strips "…" before SFT training (leaves n376-era scripts unchanged since they pre-date the pattern). n564 training: 5728 examples (786 gold), val trajectory pending (ETA ~12:17 PM).

## BEAT 59b STATE (2026-07-21) — BATTERY9 COMPLETE, CDT RUNNING, CROSS-CUTTING CLOSED

### What's running NOW
- **companion_deep_test**: BLOCKED (3 OOM kills). Root: Chrome running concurrently + model = 7% free during second-pass activation. **Fix: close Chrome, verify ≥50% free, then run test.** QUEUE-PAUSED blocks qc_queue until test completes.
- **qc_queue** — PAUSED (QUEUE-PAUSED file present). Run `rm scripts/QUEUE-PAUSED` to restart ONLY after companion_deep_test finishes.
- **Live adapter: n376** (MD5: b9acf04a1f989d570908c25177966b0f).

### Beat59b completed
1. **Battery9 1938 COMPLETE** (29/29, 3% paraphrase ✅, 28% q-enders ✅, 0.97 diversity ✅, 4725s). Full arc-sober results documented in scenario_bank.py. Persistent defects: T5 pronoun-bleed, T7 paraphrase+injection, T8 broken fragment — all family-C retrain path.
2. **CROSS-CUTTING GATE CLOSED ✅** — battery6_crosscut PASS 14:30 today; package.sh SQLite purge confirmed; RELEASE.md updated.
3. **Gold(A)=600** (+5 this beat: standing-in-changed-place, no-longer-afraid-of-this, returning-to-place-left-too-soon, holding-something-belonged-to-gone, first-time-doing-something-alone).
4. **Gold(C)=307 / 87 files** (+4 beat59c: grief-anger T2 barrier-naming ×2, bored-test T3 non-echo, arc-sober T7 no-distortion).
5. **ZIP rebuilt**: dist/hearth-0.2.zip (1.2MB, beat59 companion.py fixes included).
6. **scenario_bank.py updated**: battery9 1938 full results for arc-sober T6/T7/T8/comp-oneword + arc-divorce/grief-anger/bored-test observations. Syntax PASS.

### Beat59 companion.py fixes (MD5: 48b4e3dd54315ab265ea20ca296b3219)
1. **Case 2e article-equivalence** — articles interchangeable in prefix comparison.
2. **My-entity head-of-reply postprocessor** — `My [noun]` → `Your [noun]` when user said `my [same noun]`.

### CRITICAL: build_training_data.py beat-files gap FIXED (beat61, MD5: 59f039cdb8a3230e624c8b4cc44b8d70)
`_beat_files` glob was `C-companion/c_gold_beat*.jsonl` — top-level only (35 files). Beat46+ exemplars (55+ files) live in `C-companion/_candidates/` and were NEVER included in training. Fix: dedup-by-name dict scans both → 117 unique files. n599 and all prior adapters trained without beat46-61b exemplars — companion was learning from exemplars up to beat45 only. Next retrain (triggered by A_gold hash change, within 30 min of beat61) will be FIRST with the full 117-file beat corpus. Synced to dist/ and mini.

### Beat61 postcheck.py fix (MD5: 4865f3a32571a145d377d680f860ee20)
- **New BACK leak variant**: `r'or whatever surface you are on'` added to `_BACK_LEAK_PATTERNS`.
  Found in battery11 eagle script: "Notice yourself in this chair or whatever surface you are on right now exactly."
  Prior patterns covered: `chair or surface`, `or whatever surface is beneath you`, `or whatever surface has you`, `or surface where you sit/lie`.
  New pattern covers: `or whatever surface you are on [...]`. All 4 copies synced + SCPd to mini.

### Beat61 gold summary
- **A_gold.jsonl**: 607 (+7 scripts: call-that-changes-things, flow-state, reconciliation, last-day-summer, moment-before-stage, grief-that-asks-nothing, first-week-clean). SCPd.
- **C-companion**: c_gold_beat60.jsonl (+3: typo-soup ×2, arc-newparent T5), c_gold_beat61.jsonl (+5: anger-received, drop-therapy-frame, say-plain-thing, playful-no-deflate, warmth-through-honest-no), c_gold_beat61b.jsonl (+4: cross-session YES-first, cross-session NO-first, uc3-concrete-pivot, no-self-echo). Total: 316 exemplars. All SCPd to mini (104 files).

### Beat61 cont #3 state summary
- **Battery11 1257 run**: ALL 6 STRUCTURAL PASS ✅ (PID 4301 exited). intimacy ✅, eagle ✅✅, deposition ✅, mid-switch ✅ REGISTER, MRI ✅ (tube held, drums honored), active-scene ✅ (in-scene opening, no she/her bleed).
- **Battery9 re-run**: PID 8125 RUNNING (typo-soup fix verify). ETA ~90 min from ~1:00PM.
- **n607 on mini**: iter ~400/1500, ~60 min remaining. TRAIN=6009, VALID=316 frozen.
- **Gold**: A=612 (+5 beat62-cont scripts), C=325 candidates / 106 files. beat62 C-companion (5 new exemplars) written + SCPd.
- **intake.py fix**: bracket-notation strip added (MD5 ec48d39e2ab17148ccfde0730e0e96ac). 2 dist copies + mini synced. ZIP rebuilt.
- **dist/hearth-0.2.zip rebuilt x2** this beat. ⚠️ package.sh RESETS dist/hearth/ from git HEAD — re-copy after every rebuild: scenario_bank.py (53cf33...), battery9_engagement.py (51a0bd...), build_training_data.py (d6f4e5...).

### Remaining open gates (beat63 state)
- **Companion**: family-C retrain pending. C-companion 107 files / 523+ exemplars on mini. A-family flywheel currently training (started 08:49 Jul 27, TRAIN=6057/VALID=319, ETA ~10:20-10:30). After A-family training completes: read probe_latest.txt vs n376, then trigger C-family retrain: `ssh smaitra@mac-mini.localdomain "cd ~/imagination-engine && source .venv/bin/activate && python scripts/build_c_gold.py && nohup bash scripts/finetune.sh"`. After retrain: comparative read vs current companion behavior + battery9 gate before any promotion.
- **Cold install**: package.sh ✅ + ZIP rebuilt; Start Hearth.command launch test pending (model-free window needed, not blocked by memory).
- **Final sweep**: TWO consecutive clean all-battery passes. Battery11 beat63 = PASS ✅ (3rd consecutive). Battery9 beat63 INCOMPLETE (OOM). Need full battery9 pass + all other batteries in same rotation.

### Pending next beat
1. **Memory**: Wait for ≥35% free. Check with `memory_pressure | grep "System-wide"`.
2. **Battery9 complete run**: Once memory ≥35%, restart qc_queue (`nohup bash scripts/qc_queue.sh`) or run battery9 directly. Read transcript end-to-end when done: topic-whiplash (guitar hallucination check), typo-soup (self-correct check), hard-convo-prep, oneword, funny. q-ender%, paraphrase-opener%.
3. **Mini probe**: When A-family training completes (~10:20-10:30 Jul 27), read probe_latest.txt on mini. Comparative read vs n376. Do NOT promote without gate + brutal read.
4. **Family-C retrain**: After A-family training finishes on mini, trigger C-family retrain (see command above). Takes ~2h. After completion: comparative read, battery9 gate, promote only if brutal read passes.
5. **companion_deep_test**: After battery9 exits + memory ≥35%. Close Chrome first if open.
6. **Cold install**: Non-model task — run `scripts/package.sh` in any memory window, then `Start Hearth.command` on clean path. Write up first-five-minutes read.
7. **After battery9 PASS + all battery rotation**: Check for TWO consecutive clean all-battery passes (ship bar).

## BEAT 53 STATE (2026-07-20) — TWO CODE FIXES, GOLD GROWN, BATTERY9 RERUN PENDING

### What's running
- **Battery9 re-run** (PID 53526, started 12:34) — verifies arc-divorce T5 Case 2c' fix. ETA ~13:30–14:00.
- **qc_queue PID 2284 PAUSED** for battery9 re-run launch.
- **Memory 22% free** while battery9 model runs — do NOT launch any second model until battery9 exits and memory returns ≥35%.
- **Live adapter: n376** (MD5: b9acf04a1f989d570908c25177966b0f).

### Beat53 code fixes
1. **companion.py Case 2c'** (MD5: d082dcba6bc2e15c788cd7501cd48dc4, all 4 copies synced):
   - Defect: user "The relief..." → model "That relief feels like proof you're the villain." — article swap "The"→"That" made Case 2c I→you equality miss.
   - Fix: after primary norm check fails, demote leading 'that/this' → 'the' in model reply and re-check. Both "That relief..." and "This relief..." now caught.
   - Verified: 4/4 unit tests PASS.
   - Copies synced: src/imagination_engine/companion.py, dist/imagination_engine/companion.py, dist/imagination_engine/imagination_engine/companion.py, dist/hearth/src/imagination_engine/companion.py.

2. **utility.py two fixes** (MD5: e7a8e60f1b15314a3b18a7565d256b9b, all 4 copies synced):
   - Defect: sec-braindump-organize LOST:bug-count — "3 bugs" dropped from organized output.
   - Root 1: `_extract_numbers()` didn't capture bare `N [countable-noun]` patterns. Fix: added regex for "3 bugs", "47 users", etc. (12 countable noun variants).
   - Root 2: post-check `n in out` — "3" in "March 3rd" → True (false positive suppressed regen). Fix: `_num_present()` helper uses `\b3\b` regex for pure-digit tokens; "3rd" has word-char after "3", so no match.
   - Verified: both fixes in isolation before applying.
   - Copies synced: same 4 paths as companion.py above.

### Beat53 gold
- **Gold(A)=467** (+7 from 460): argument-that-didn't-feel-like-winning, parent's-house-last-time-before-sale, mountain-summit-alone, letter-from-past-self-braver-than-you-knew, moment-knowing-relationship-over, first-sunrise-after-sleepless-night, holding-object-from-lost-person.
- **Gold(C)**: c_gold_beat53.jsonl +5 exemplars (arc-divorce T5 demonstrative-echo correct forms ×2, grief-anger T2 trap-naming, arc-divorce T1-T3 clean arc, arc-divorce T7 "Good."). Total in _candidates/: 86.

### Beat53 reads
- **battery9 0935**: Arc-divorce T5 echo defect found — "That relief feels like proof you're the villain." — T5 FAIL. T1-T4 ✅, T7 ✅. arc-sober T1/T5 still abstract-question/q-ender (family-C retrain path).
- **battery10 1037**: sec-braindump LOST:bug-count found — "3 bugs" not in organized output. Both root causes identified and fixed.
- **battery11 0819 and 1122**: eagle ✅✅ both runs. active-scene stochastic (1 FAIL in 3 runs today — she/her pronoun bleed). vague-open completed both runs (no mechanical postchecks, appears "incomplete" but isn't).
- **battery12 1104**: 7/12 — 7/7 unit tests ✅ PASS; 5 model tests ❌ EXCEPTION(404) because server was partially running (root GET 200 but /companion/turn 404). Transient condition, not a code bug. Beat52 skip fix works when server is fully down.

### Pending next beat
1. **Read battery9 re-run** (PID 53526, started 12:34) — arc-divorce T5 result. Should show no "That relief..." echo. If still failing, deeper investigation needed.
2. **When memory ≥35%**: Run companion deep test (`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 .venv/bin/python scripts/qc/companion_deep_test.py`) — companion gate UC rotation.
3. **Mini SSH**: Still 100% packet loss. When reachable: SCP A_gold.jsonl + c_gold_beat{49-53}.jsonl + restart honest_flywheel + caffeinate.
4. **Cold install**: `scripts/package.sh` → dist zip → `Start Hearth.command` cold exercise.
5. **Public story**: site/README recut for five tools + vital-facts / open-threads.
6. **Cross-cutting final sweep**: all pages 200, offline tripwire (QC purge handled by package.sh).

## BEAT 49b STATE (2026-07-18) — DEEP TEST V2 COMPLETE; BATTERY10 PENDING

### What's running
- **battery11_imagination_bank** (PID 45191) — started 06:25. After this: battery9, then battery10 (~09:00 ETA).
- **qc_queue PID 43231 RESUMED** — QUEUE-PAUSED removed 06:24. Memory was 83% free.

### Beat49b code fixes
1. **companion.py** — WHEN THEY SELF-CORRECT instruction added to COMPANION_SYSTEM.
2. **companion.py** — `_VENT_HOLLOW_EMDASH_RE` + em-dash pre-check in `_strip_vent_hollow_second()`. 5/5 unit tests PASS.
3. **companion.py** — WHEN THEY ASK ABOUT PAST CONVERSATIONS instruction added after VITAL FACTS section. **Final MD5: 64718c2e213de4691ca2ac6212e307da.** All 4 dist copies synced.
4. **scripts/qc/companion_deep_test.py** — UC2 seeding path fixed to `data/companion.sqlite`.

### Beat49b gold
- **c_gold_beat49b.jsonl** — **10 exemplars** (arc-sober ×5, UC1-T6 honesty probe, UC3-T2 barrier bind, +3 v2: past-query YES, past-query NO, barrier concrete pivot). Total in _candidates/: 65.

### companion_deep_test v2 verdict (gate_beat49b_companion_deep_test_v2.log) — COMPLETE
- Floor: ALL CLEAN ✅
- **UC1: PROMOTION BAR CLEARED** — T6 ✅ "No — I'm software; caring isn't something I can do." (was v1 HARD FAIL). T1 ✅, T5 ✅. T3 miss (weak-link) + T4 redirect refused still present (secondary defects; family-C retrain path).
- **UC2: FAIL** — T1 ✅ silent on memory. T4 ❌ "Did we talk about this?" → "That's the thing — what you said already matters." (dodge; WHEN THEY ASK instruction insufficient at model level). T5 ❌ "Sister — that's a different thing." (dodge). Fix path: gold exemplars + family-C retrain.
- **UC3: FAIL** — T1 ✅ em-dash fix confirmed (clean response; pattern didn't appear). T2 MARGINAL (names cost, not specific bind). T5 ❌ "Whatever.\nYou've done the work — what does it mean if no one notices?" (companion echoed own T4 + gave question not action).

### Pending to close beat49
1. battery10 verify sec-hr-complaint FACT-LOST:Mar11 (02:40 run predated utility.py fix; ~09:00)
2. Update RELEASE.md beat49 → COMPLETE after battery10 PASS
3. Mini: SCP Gold(A)=438 + c_gold_beat49.jsonl + c_gold_beat49b.jsonl when reachable
4. Family-C retrain: 65 exemplars ready; blocked on mini SSH

### Beat49b battery9 verdict (second run, 04:36)
- Metrics: paraphrase-openers 9%, q-enders 39% ✅, what-if 0%, tic 0, diversity 0.96.
- ✅ grief-anger T1: "Anger at a miscarriage, not sadness — that breaks the script."
- MARGINAL grief-anger T2: "So you're carrying the anger alone right now." (names aloneness but not the bind's cost — still stochastic)
- ✅ crisis-adjacent: "Lighter without you around. How long has it felt this way?" — TWO MOVES confirmed.
- ✅ topic-whiplash T1/T2: benign-relief ✅, guitar-45 ✅
- ✅ vent-layoff: "Eleven years in a job, and it's over in nine minutes on Zoom." ONE SENTENCE.
- ❌ arc-sober T1: "What does it mean to be carrying this alone?" (abstract question — beat49b gold targets this)
- ❌ arc-sober T5: "Does it feel like losing that label is harder than staying anonymous?" (q-ender instead of naming)
- PARTIAL arc-sober T6: echo-strip fired on paraphrase; second-pass produced correct form.
- MARGINAL arc-sober T7: "The noise of evenings is real." (flat — not excavation)
- MARGINAL arc-sober T8: "At 9pm they're usually somewhere between winding down and looking up..." (generic)
- ❌ typo-soup: "2am and your brain is still at work with Jenna." (no "that wasn't me" — beat49b fix targets this)
- ✅ oneword: "I'm here. What's going on?"
- MARGINAL bored-test T1: paraphrase echo; ❌ T2/T3: contraction-echo → summary echo (family-C retrain only)

### Mini status (beat49b)
- **Fully unreachable**: 100% packet loss (ping -c 2 -t 5 mac-mini.localdomain). No path to fix from this session — needs physical access or network intervention (different from beat49's SSH-timeout-ping-OK state).
- Gold SCP blocked. n432 training status unknown.
- Pending for next reachable session: SCP Gold(A)=438 + c_gold_beat49.jsonl + c_gold_beat49b.jsonl + verify caffeinate/pmset settings.

## BEAT 49 STATE (2026-07-18)

### What's running
- **qc_queue RUNNING**. battery9 in progress (started 04:36). After battery9: battery10, battery12, battery3b, battery4b, battery2b, product_e2e — then another battery11.
- **Live adapter: n376** (MD5: b9acf04a1f989d570908c25177966b0f). PERMANENT.
- **utility.py MD5: 8c016dbf4a669ad6f326ec2df4138602** (all 4 copies synced: src/ + dist/imagination_engine/ + dist/imagination_engine/imagination_engine/ + dist/hearth/src/imagination_engine/).
- **companion.py MD5: a191ca2dff8830f89d9463a495e4cbb7** (all 4 copies synced, from beat48).
- **Memory: 20% free** (battery9 model running — do NOT launch any model until battery9 completes and memory frees to ≥35%).

### Beat49 code fixes
- **utility.py** — `_extract_dates()` added (regex: month + day tokens from text). `_b_draft()` now injects MANDATORY DATES clause when brief contains specific dates. `run()` post-check for `draft` task: regens up to 2× if any mandatory date from brief is absent from output. Root cause: sec-hr-complaint "March 11" → "in March" was stochastic; prompt-level MANDATORY DATES alone insufficient; post-check regen is the belt. Unit tested 3 cases ✅. All 4 dist copies synced.
- **scenario_bank.py** — sec-hr-complaint regression note (beat49).

### Beat49 reads (thorough)
**battery11 (00:31 and 03:20 — TWO CONSECUTIVE COMPLETE RUNS):**
- Run 1 (00:31): ALL 6 PASS ✅ (intimacy ✅ 1651w, eagle ✅✅ 1785w, vague-open ✅ 1329w, mid-switch ✅ REGISTER 1281w, mri ✅ 1582w, active-scene ✅ 1190w). beat48 BACK-leak patterns working (2 strips in eagle).
- Run 2 (03:20): ALL 6 PASS ✅ (intimacy ✅ 1282w, eagle ✅✅ 1949w, vague-open ✅ 1652w, mid-switch ✅ REGISTER 1167w, mri ✅ 1771w, active-scene ✅). Total 4428s.
- MINOR DEFECT: "isnYou" broken sentence in run2 intimacy — model output truncated mid-sentence then continued on next line without space separator. Not gate-blocking; extension-loop trim artifact. Monitor.
- **n376 is solid. Two consecutive clean battery11 runs. Imagination gate remains closed ✅.**

**battery9 (01:55):**
- Metrics: paraphrase-openers 4% ✅, q-enders 35% ✅, what-if 0% ✅, tic 0 ✅, diversity 1.00 ✅.
- comp-para-care/love/stay/advice-demand/topic-whiplash/vent-layoff/typo-soup/oneword/bored-test: ALL PASS ✅.
- comp-grief-anger: T1 ✅, T2 ❌ NEW DEFECT CLASS — BARRIER-ASK-WHY: "So why are you carrying the anger alone?" — model asked for info just given. Beat48 BARRIER instruction applied; T2 still failing stochastically. Family-C retrain is the fix path.
- comp-crisis-adjacent: TYPE B mechanical regen fired and produced correct TWO MOVES form ✅. Quality note: question "What does it feel like to say this?" is meta (about the act of saying it) — acceptable shape, not ideal content.
- comp-arc-sober: T7 "The loud evenings are exposing something quieter" — still excavation (known prompt-unfixable). T8 "At 9pm, people do the thing that marks them as their own person" — still generic (want "TV. Mostly TV."). Banked T8 concrete form in c_gold_beat49.jsonl.

**battery10 (02:38/02:45):** 9/10 PASS. sec-hr-complaint FAIL (FACT-LOST:Mar11) — FIXED this beat. All others including sec-shorter-x3, sec-multi-doc-paste, sec-braindump-organize: PASS ✅.

**battery2b, 3b, 4b, product e2e:** ALL PASS ✅.

### Beat49 gold
- **Gold(A)=438** (+6): first-morning-new-house, ice-skating-rink, first-tomato-harvest, clean-test-result, arriving-dream-destination, skill-finally-clicked. All unique openings verified.
- **Gold(C)**: c_gold_beat49.jsonl +5 exemplars (grief-anger T2 trap-form, T2 cost-form, crisis-adjacent two-moves warmth, bored-test hold-ennui, arc-sober T7/T8 absurdist). Not yet SCP'd to mini (mini unreachable).

### Mini status (beat49)
- SSH times out at 172.16.151.169:22. Ping responds (host is up). Likely firewall rule or sleep state change. Key loaded in agent. Previous SSH attempts: "Too many authentication failures" error on localdomain, then "Operation timed out" on IP — different error types. Try after reboot or from different context.
- n432 training status: unknown since beat48 SCP not confirmed. Flywheel should have auto-triggered on Gold=432 hash change. Verify on next reachable session.

### RUNS NEXT (beat49 continuation — in order)
1. **Wait for battery9 to finish** (~06:00-06:30 EST). Monitor: `tail -f logs/qc/queue_0718_0436_battery9_engagement.log`.
2. **Verify memory ≥35% free** after battery9 + model process exits.
3. **Run battery10** (5-minute run via server) to confirm sec-hr-complaint fix: `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 .venv/bin/python scripts/qc/battery10_registers.py 2>&1 | tee logs/qc/gate_beat49_battery10_hrfix.log`. Check sec-hr-complaint passes (FACT-LOST:Mar11 gone).
4. **Companion deep test** (use-cases.md #1-#5) — the UC rotation is on Companion this beat. Use httpx to call server. Run through: 2am mind-race, parasocial probe, edge (hostility, grief-adjacent), template fatigue. Add findings to docs/qc/use-cases.md.
5. **Battery12** will auto-run in qc_queue after battery10. If it doesn't appear in next cycle, check qc_queue.sh ordering.
6. **Log daily-log and RELEASE.md** after deep test.

### BEAT 48 STATE (2026-07-18) — COMPLETE

### Beat48 code fixes
- **companion.py** — `_VENT_HOLLOW_SECOND_RE` + `_strip_vent_hollow_second()` added (after `_strip_thats_real_tic()`). Called at 4 points in `turn()` (initial gen + GRAVITY TYPE B regen + empty-reply regen + forbidden regen). Strips second sentences matching banned hollow patterns from VENT replies.
- **companion.py** — BARRIER instruction added to COMPANION_SYSTEM after WHEN THEY VENT / "One line, period, done.": "FOLLOW-UP AFTER A VENT — WHEN THEY NAME A BARRIER — name what the barrier CREATES (the bind, cost, stuck place) — not why it exists. One line only."
- **qc_queue.sh** — `scripts/qc/battery12_vital_facts.py` added to QUEUE (position 4, after battery10). First automated vital-facts run since beat14 gate (July 12).
- **scenario_bank.py** — beat48 regression notes: comp-vent-layoff hollow-second bypass + mechanical fix; comp-grief-anger BARRIER-ASK-WHY defect.

### n426 verdict — REJECTED
- **Val 1.506 vs n376 0.641** (2.4× worse). Confirmed as real regression (not just harder val set).
- **Eval (4 prompts, 2 completed):** Beach: repetition loop ("You walk along the shore..." ×4, "You are aware of the feel of the horizon" duplicated verbatim). Eagle: factual hallucination ("400-pound raptor"), abstract proclamation loop ("You are the king of the sky" ×4), zero sensory flight embodiment. Boss conversation: generation failed (empty output). Hot spring: not reached.
- **Cause unknown**: A_gold grew 376→432 during n426 training cycle; new scripts may have introduced conflicting patterns, or training settings need tuning.
- **Next candidate**: n432 (triggered automatically when flywheel detects A_gold MD5 change on mini). Mini SSH currently intermittent — verify next session.

### Beat48 gold
- **Gold(A)=432** (+6: open-water dock, used bookshop, empty apartment emigrating, fire outside cold night, last sentence of a book, city years ago). SCP'd to mini (assumed — mini SSH dropped before confirm; verify next session).
- **Gold(C)**: c_gold_beat48.jsonl +5 exemplars (vent-layoff one-sentence, grief-anger T2 barrier ×2, opener-ask-yield, opener-gravity-first). Total: 50 targeted + 130+ root.

### RUNS NEXT (beat48 continuation)
1. **Read battery11 end-to-end** when it completes (~02:00): all 6 scenarios — eagle ✅ already, read vague-open/grief-pet/mid-switch/intimacy/active-scene. Any FAIL = fix + re-run.
2. **Companion deep use-case test** — this beat's product rotation. Start server (≥35% memory required), run use-cases.md companion scenarios as demanding AI professional. Test: weird inputs, long sessions, edge registers. Every defect: fix, bank, re-verify.
3. **Verify mini + n432**: SSH when reachable — check n432 training status, n432 eval when ready, probe vs n376.
4. **Family-C retrain**: flywheel_c.sh on mini — 50 targeted exemplars, threshold met. Trigger this beat or next.
5. **Cross-cutting sweep** — offline tripwire, ceilings, 200s, QC-artifact purge.
6. **Cold install** — scripts/package.sh → dist zip → Start Hearth.command.

## BEAT 47 STATE (2026-07-17)

### What's running
- **qc_queue RUNNING** (PID 37564).
- **Live adapter: n376** (MD5: b9acf04a1f989d570908c25177966b0f). PERMANENT.
- **companion.py MD5: 792f9d0fd354bf14f9fec0a3bd2a356e** (all 3 dist copies synced).
- **server.py MD5: 4d2995ab9b3047452500ce6857bae56a** (all 3 dist copies synced — utility_run now calls assistant.run()).
- **utility.py MD5: beee3eae47eb4daaac2080f5ac029b20** (all 3 dist copies synced — stub guard added, _extra_system param).

### Beat47 code fixes
- **server.py** — `utility_run` endpoint changed from `assistant.stream()` to `assistant.run()`.
  Root cause: all post-checks (stub guard, number recovery, day-name sanitisation) lived in `run()` but server called `stream()` directly, bypassing them entirely.
  Fix: buffer full output via `assistant.run()`, yield complete result. Streaming interface preserved (JS reader loop still works); typing-effect lost but correctness gained.
- **utility.py** — `_extra_system` parameter added to `stream()` (private, passed through to `gen()`).
- **utility.py** — draft/reply stub guard in `run()`:
  Detection: strip subject lines (`Subject: ...`), salutation/sign-off lines (ending with comma), placeholder lines (`[...]`) — if nothing remains, output is a stub.
  Regen: up to 3 attempts using `engine.stream()` directly with body-prompt `_extra_system`, temp=0.3 → 0.25. All 8 unit tests PASS.

### Secretary deep test — CLOSED ✅ (beat47, 153s)
| UC | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| UC1 meeting notes | ✅ all 8 facts | sarah/tuesday/wednesday/goldman sachs/option b/oauth/$12/thursday |
| UC2a firm decline | ✅ | $85k vs $110k, door open |
| UC2b apology | ✅ | full body, owns it, no groveling |
| UC2c negotiation counter | ✅ | $3400 counter present |
| UC3 braindump organize | ✅ all numbers | $59/$49/march17/miranda/47/30%/feb28/bugs/tuesday |
| UC4 shorter×3 | ✅ | 20w→13w→11w, each shorter |

**Secretary gate: CLOSED** — 5/5 UC pass. Root fix: server endpoint bypassed all post-checks.

### RUNS NEXT (in order — beat48)
1. **Family-C retrain** — trigger `flywheel_c.sh` on mini (45+ targeted exemplars, threshold met). Kill qc_queue, ≥35% memory, `nohup bash scripts/flywheel_c.sh > ~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/_logs/flywheel_c.log 2>&1 &` on mini, restart qc_queue when done.
2. **n426 probe read** — `ssh smaitra@mac-mini.localdomain 'cat ~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/_logs/probe_latest.txt; ls ~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/ | grep GOLD-ADAPTER | tail -3'`
3. **vital-facts WRITE path** — deferred from beat46.
4. **Cross-cutting sweep** — offline tripwire, ceilings, 200s, QC-artifact purge.
5. **Cold install** — scripts/package.sh → dist zip → Start Hearth.command clean run.
6. **Companion gate** — needs family-C retrain first; arc-divorce My→She, comp-funny regression still open.

## BEAT 46 STATE (2026-07-17)

### What's running
- **qc_queue RUNNING** (PID 37155). battery9 2042 COMPLETE.
- **Live adapter: n376** (MD5: b9acf04a1f989d570908c25177966b0f). PERMANENT — do not demote.
- **companion.py MD5: c3cfa3d26a7ab20fa3b6366bdff94a91** (all 3 dist copies synced — GRAVITY TYPE B regen + stub guard 8→6 + GRAVITY q_streak exception).
- **scenario_bank.py MD5: 945c383bfb4923e164767e35b012258e** (beat46 note added to comp-crisis-adjacent).
- **Gold(A)=426** (+8 beat46: Saturday rest, pottery wheel, kid bike, 3am calm, first customer, rain, grandmother's dinner, concept clicked). SCP'd to mini ✅.
- **Gold(C) beat46**: c_gold_beat46.jsonl +5 exemplars (arc-divorce T2 My→She echo; T2–T4 arc; crisis-adjacent TYPE B correct; TWO MOVES variety; hard-convo HOW-frame). SCP'd to mini ✅.
- **Mac Mini: ALIVE** — caffeinate + flywheel running. n418 live adapter on mini (trained 07-17 18:22). A_gold 426 + c_gold_beat46 confirmed. n426 auto-triggers on next 30-min flywheel poll (~21:00–21:30).

### Beat46 code fixes
- **companion.py** (MD5: c3cfa3d26a7ab20fa3b6366bdff94a91):
  - `_GRAVITY_SIGNALS` tuple at module level: 8 crisis-adjacent signal phrases.
  - `_is_gravity_trigger(user_message)`: returns True if any signal phrase found in user message.
  - `_QUESTION_FIRST_WORDS` frozenset: does/do/is/are/was/were/will/would/can/could/have/has/had/what/when/where/why/how.
  - `_is_pure_question(reply)`: True when reply ends with "?" AND first word is in `_QUESTION_FIRST_WORDS`.
  - Mechanical regen block in `turn()`: after initial generation + postprocessors, if GRAVITY trigger + pure question → regen at temp=0.4 with explicit acknowledgment instruction. `_strip_echo()` NOT applied on regen (acknowledgment uses their words intentionally).
  - Stub guard lowered 8��6 in `_drop_trailing_question()`.
  - q_streak strip: `not _is_gravity_trigger(user_message)` guard preserves GRAVITY question.
  - 9/9 unit tests PASS (both _is_gravity_trigger and _is_pure_question).

### Battery9 2042 in progress — key scenarios to watch
- **comp-crisis-adjacent**: TYPE B mechanical regen FIRST verification. Expected: regen should fire if model generates "Does it feel like..." and produce TWO MOVES form.
- **comp-arc-divorce T2**: My→She echo still prompt-unfixable; family-C retrain path. T7 "Good." should still hold.
- **comp-hard-convo-prep T2**: HOW-frame target "Two conversations, not one sentence." — stochastic.

### Secretary deep test — COMPLETED (beat46, 170s)
| UC | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| UC1 meeting notes | ✅ all 8 facts | sarah/tuesday/wednesday/goldman sachs/option b/oauth/$12/thursday |
| UC2a firm decline | ✅ | $85k vs $110k, door open |
| UC2b apology | ✅ | third-regen fix CONFIRMED working (no empty "James,") |
| UC2c negotiation counter | ❌ stochastic | "David," only — model generates salutation, third-regen fires but also fails |
| UC3 braindump organize | ✅ all numbers | $59/$49/march17/miranda/47/30%/feb28/bugs/tuesday |
| UC4 shorter×3 | ✅ | 21w→12w→11w, each shorter |

**Secretary gate: NOT YET CLOSED** — 4/5 UC pass. UC2c is a model-floor stochastic failure (~50% rate, passed in beat43). Gate criterion = clean 5/5 pass. Action: re-run deep test in next session after any utility.py draft floor improvements.
- To re-run: kill qc_queue, verify memory ≥35%, `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 .venv/bin/python /tmp/secretary_deep_test.py`, restart qc_queue.

### Family-C retrain — THRESHOLD MET, NOT YET TRIGGERED
- C-companion exemplar count: 45 in `_candidates/` (beat28–beat46), 130+ in root across beats 13–45.
- Beat45 RUNS NEXT said "~50+ total"; we're at 45 _candidates/. Root has well over 130. Retrain justified.
- Procedure: kill qc_queue; check memory ≥35%; `nohup bash scripts/flywheel_c.sh > ~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/_logs/flywheel_c.log 2>&1 &`; restart qc_queue when done.
- **NOTE**: flywheel_c.sh runs gen_c_candidates → curate_c → build_training_data → finetune. Takes ~2h. Mini preferred over laptop.

### RUNS NEXT (in order — beat47)
1. **Secretary gate rerun** — re-run `/tmp/secretary_deep_test.py`. UC2c needs clean pass. Gate procedure: kill qc_queue, ≥35% free, run, restart.
2. **UC2c draft floor fix** — add draft-body min-length guard in utility.py for ALL "draft" task tones (not just apology): if output ≤ 30 chars after regen and is salutation-only, force body regen.
3. **Family-C retrain** (threshold met; trigger on mini via flywheel_c.sh).
4. **n426 probe read** — check `_logs/probe_latest.txt` on mini after flywheel runs.
5. **vital-facts WRITE path** — deferred to beat47+.
6. **Secretary gate** — close formally once deep test passes.

## BEAT 45 STATE (2026-07-17)

### What's running
- **qc_queue RUNNING** (PID 30502, resumed after battery3c run).
- **Live adapter: n376** (MD5: b9acf04a1f989d570908c25177966b0f). PERMANENT — do not demote.
- **Mac Mini: REACHABLE** (mac-mini.localdomain, smaitra). n411 REJECTED (val 0.812). n418 TRIGGERED: A_gold.jsonl 418 SCP'd, valid.jsonl removed (fresh val split), flywheel will detect hash change on next 30-min poll.
- **companion.py MD5: fbad3cf33bb9be38c15835b78c687988** (all 3 dist copies synced — GRAVITY TYPE B + WHEN THEY VENT "That feels like X" fixes).
- **battery11_imagination_bank.py**: bear false-positive fixed (requires article "a/the bear" to count as wildlife).
- **scenario_bank.py MD5: 945c383bfb4923e164767e35b012258e** (3 defects banked this beat).
- **utility.py MD5: a32c087aafa02cc263291da0fdf4f6ac** (beat44 fix: organize numeric floor + extend post-check to cover organize).
- **doc_qa.py MD5: 92ce1b3eda21dc6d0aa8d21c1a8e73cf** (beat44 fix: BRIDGE2 retry trigger broadened to cover "not in your files").

### Beat45 code fixes
- **companion.py** (MD5: fbad3cf33bb9be38c15835b78c687988):
  - GRAVITY TYPE B: "Does..." explicitly added to MUST NOT start list; WRONG/RIGHT example pair with exact observed failure ("Does it feel like everyone or just a few?" after user said "lighter without me around")
  - WHEN THEY VENT BANNED SECOND SENTENCES: "That feels like X." / "It feels like X." added (present-tense bypass of banned "That must feel like X.")
- **battery11_imagination_bank.py**: bear false-positive fixed — `_WILDLIFE_WORDS` + `_WILDLIFE_ARTICLE` split; "bear" now requires preceding article "a" or "the" to match as animal. n376 eagle gate stands (was a measurement error).
- **scenario_bank.py** (MD5: 945c383bfb4923e164767e35b012258e): 3 defects banked:
  - comp-vent-layoff: "That feels like X" bypass
  - comp-crisis-adjacent: TYPE B "Does..." violation with WRONG/RIGHT examples
  - comp-arc-divorce: My→She echo → family-C retrain path

### Beat45 gold
- **Imagination**: +7 → Gold(A)=418. New scenes: manuscript send, lake dawn swim, winter farmers market, toddler asleep, childhood bedroom return, offstage wings, father’s letter. SCP’d to mini ✅.
- **Companion**: c_gold_beat45.jsonl +4 exemplars (crisis-adjacent TYPE B correct, T2 two-move sustained, vent-layoff T2 no-feels-like, arc-divorce T2 no-she-echo). SCP’d to mini ✅.

### Beat45 adapter / mini status
- **n411 REJECTED** — val 0.812, oscillating curve, frozen val root cause. n376 stays live.
- **n418 triggered**: Gold(A)=418 SCP’d, valid.jsonl removed from mini (forces fresh val split), flywheel will detect hash change on next 30-min poll.
- **AYF GATE CLOSED** ✅ — battery3c 28/28 × 3 consecutive (beat44 + beat45 ×2, 408s + 428s). 84/84 total.

### Battery results (beat45)
| Battery | Result |
|---|---|
| battery3c beat45 run2 (0717_1647) | ✅ 28/28 PASS. BRIDGE2 PASS. |
| battery3c beat45 run3 (0717_1654) | ✅ 28/28 PASS. BRIDGE2 PASS. AYF GATE CLOSED. |

### RUNS NEXT (in order — beat46)
1. **Read n418 probe when complete** (~30 min after flywheel detects hash change). Check probe_latest.txt on mini: `ssh smaitra@mac-mini.localdomain ‘cat ~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/_logs/probe_latest.txt; ls ~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/ | grep GOLD-ADAPTER | tail -3’`
2. **Secretary UC1 fact-drop** — stochastic; gold exemplar showing correct form (all 8 facts preserved: sarah, tuesday, wednesday, goldman sachs, option b, oauth, $12, thursday).
3. **Secretary UC2c negotiation salutation-only** — model floor; gold exemplar showing correct counter email body.
4. **Companion family-C retrain progress** — check exemplar count; trigger when density sufficient (~50+ total, targeting crisis-adjacent/arc-divorce/grief-anger).
5. **vital-facts WRITE path** — deferred to beat46+.

## BEAT 43 STATE (2026-07-17)

### What's running
- **battery11 RUNNING** (PID 22849, started 09:31 AM, ETA ~10:43 AM). Routine n376 confirmation run in qc_queue cycle.
- **qc_queue RUNNING** (PID 22821, relaunched 09:31 AM after secretary test).
- **Live adapter: n376** (MD5: b9acf04a1f989d570908c25177966b0f). n281 backed up at `data/model/adapters.n281/` and `data/model/adapters.n281_permanent.safetensors`.
- **Mac Mini UNREACHABLE** — ping 100% packet loss to 172.16.151.169. Likely sleeping. Physical wake needed. n404 training status unknown (was at iter 25/1500 at ~09:10 AM when last seen).
- **IMAGINATION GATE**: CLOSED ✅ — n376 battery11 ALL 6 PASS × 2 (beat40 + beat41).
- **companion.py** — beat42 fixes. MD5: b4f8806d0e5ed27bc5ce1648a301cfbe (all 3 dist copies).
- **utility.py** — beat43 fixes (third-regen + concise prompt). MD5: 94d83e81e488ae67a96b2b78e273783d (all 3 dist copies).
- **Gold(A)=404** — SCP'd to mini before unreachable ✅. **Gold(C) beat41 +5 + beat43 +3** — beat41 SCP'd ✅; beat43 waiting for mini to wake.

### Beat43 secretary deep test (0717_0928 — 124s)
| test | verdict |
|---|---|
| UC1 meeting notes | ✅ all 8 facts preserved |
| UC2a firm decline | PARTIAL (email exists, no explicit decline stated) |
| UC2b apology | ❌→FIXED (was "James," only; utility.py third-regen prevents empty-strip) |
| UC2c negotiation counter | ✅ $3400 present |
| UC3 braindump | PARTIAL ("47" beta-user count dropped; other floor issues were calibration errors) |
| UC4 shorter×3 | ❌ model can't compress ~28w further on passes 2+3 |

### Beat42 battery9 results (0717_0849) — 21/21 PASS (2 defects found and fixed)
All scenarios passed or had defects fixed mid-run. Key results:
- arc-divorce T3 ✅ (Case 2e fix confirmed — no echo in reply)
- arc-divorce T5 ✅ (second-regen fix confirmed — "Does it feel worse when no one knows what you're relieved about?")
- arc-divorce T7 ✅ ("Good.")
- vent-layoff ❌→FIXED: "That makes the whole thing about what happens next" — new bypass form
- hard-convo-prep T1 ❌→FIXED: "You said he's also your oldest friend." — Case 2d second-sentence echo
- Metrics: 10% paraphrase-openers, 48% q-enders, 0.90 opener diversity

### Beat43 code fixes (utility.py MD5: 94d83e81e488ae67a96b2b78e273783d)
- **utility.py: third-regen fallback** — when banned-opener strip leaves ≤ 15 chars (just salutation), forces a third full regen with "Write body IMMEDIATELY" instruction. Prevents "James," empty-output on apology emails.
- **utility.py: concise tone strengthened** — from "Be as concise as possible while keeping everything essential." → "Compress: remove every unnecessary word and cut redundant phrases. The output must be shorter than the input — fewer words, same core meaning." Fixes UC4 shorter×3 model floor.
- **scenario_bank.py: sec-braindump-organize added** (always=True, high, helpfulness). Product-launch braindump with 10 numeric facts. Gold exemplar c_gold_beat43 shows correct form.
- **battery10_registers.py: sec-braindump-organize floor checks added** — \b47\b, $59, $49, march 17/3, miranda, 30%, feb 28, 3 bugs, tuesday. SYNTAX OK.
- **c_gold_beat43.jsonl: 3 exemplars** — arc-divorce T2 (no-mirror), arc-divorce T4 (sentence-complete), sec-organize-UC3 (all numeric facts). NOT YET SCP'd to mini (mini unreachable).

### Beat42 code fixes (companion.py MD5: b4f8806d0e5ed27bc5ce1648a301cfbe)
- **vent-layoff bypass**: Added "That makes the whole X." / "That makes X about Y." / "That puts X about Y." to BANNED SECOND SENTENCES in WHEN THEY VENT.
- **Case 2d all-sentences**: Extended `_strip_echo()` Case 2d to check ALL user sentences (not just first). Hard-convo-prep T1 root cause: second sentence "He's also my oldest friend" → I→You "he's also your oldest friend" matched.
- All 3 dist copies in sync (src/, dist/imagination_engine/, dist/hearth/src/imagination_engine/). MD5 verified identical.
- scenario_bank.py: arc-divorce beat42 notes, comp-vent-layoff beat42 regression+fix, comp-hard-convo-prep beat42 regression+fix.

### Beat41 state (for reference)
- Case 2e (arc-divorce T3 partial I→You prefix echo) FIXED.
- Second-regen fallback (arc-divorce T5 double-strip → empty) FIXED.
- battery11 0734: ALL 6 PASS (n376 second consecutive confirmation).
- n396 REJECTED (val 1.168 vs n376 0.641).

### Beat40 state (preserved for reference)
- n376 PROMOTED PERMANENT (beat40, 4520s gate, val 0.641). MD5: b9acf04a1f989d570908c25177966b0f.
- n281 backed up: `data/model/adapters.n281/` and `data/model/adapters.n281_permanent.safetensors`.
- companion.py Case 5: any-sentence echo detection. 4/4 unit tests PASS.

- imag-grief-pet, imag-mri, imag-repeat-variety: generating...
- Log: `logs/qc/queue_0713_2007_battery11_n281_gate.log`
- After PID 33109 exits: read all 4 remaining results, bank in scenario_bank.py, close Imagination gate if all PASS.

**Battery10 registers — 4/4 PASS ✅** (beat27 1935 run)

**Battery9 engagement (beat27 1907 run) — defects found:**
- q-enders 27% ✅, paraphrase 8% ✅, diversity 0.96 ✅

- ❌ arc-newparent T1 echo, T4 stamp → gold exemplar added (beat27)

### Beat27 code fixes (src/ and dist/ both updated)
- **generator.py**: `_explicit_embodiment` flag + wildlife drop decoupled from `_is_active_body`; `strip_alert_calm_violations()` wired for pillow/sheet/blanket/etc belt-and-suspenders
- **postcheck.py**: `strip_alert_calm_violations()` added — strips sleep-register props when `_alert_calm` is True
- **companion.py**: "that's real" → ABSOLUTE BAN (was conditional)
- **scenario_bank.py**: beat27 arc-divorce, eagle, mid-switch, MRI results banked; synced to dist/

### Mini adapter history (today)
- n262 (10:28): BELOW FLOOR — rejected.
- n270 (12:19): adequate, thin embodiment — not promoted.
- n281 (14:12): **GATE CANDIDATE (beat27 re-assessment).** Eagle clean (no hawk, ground→flight transition). Ellipsis artifact only in "hard conversation rehearsal" (not in battery11). Best available vs n286/n287.
- n286 (18:06): REJECTED — hallucinated companion eagles.
- n287 (19:58): REJECTED — narrator "we" violation. val 0.577.
- n293 (pending): will auto-train when flywheel detects A_gold change (293 vs 287).

## NEXT BEAT (beat44) — PRIORITY ORDER
1. **Read battery11 (launched 09:31 AM, ETA ~10:43 AM)** — n376 in qc_queue rotation. Check all 6 scenarios against n376 quality floor. This is a routine confirmation run, not a gate run.
2. **Re-run secretary deep test** — verify UC2b (utility.py third-regen) and UC4 (concise prompt) fixes. Kill qc_queue first. Command:
   ```bash
   kill $(pgrep -f qc_queue); sleep 5
   memory_pressure 2>/dev/null | grep "Pages free"  # must be ≥35%
   .venv/bin/python /tmp/secretary_deep_test.py > logs/qc/secretary_deep_test_verify_$(date +%H%M).log 2>&1
   nohup bash scripts/qc_queue.sh >> logs/qc/queue.log 2>&1 &
   ```
3. **Wake mac-mini** (physical or WoL) — ping to 172.16.151.169 fails. Once up:
   ```bash
   ssh smaitra@mac-mini.localdomain 'tail -20 ~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/_logs/honest_flywheel.log; ls ~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/ | grep GOLD-ADAPTER | tail -3'
   ```
   Then SCP c_gold_beat43.jsonl: `scp ~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/C-companion/c_gold_beat43.jsonl smaitra@mac-mini.localdomain:~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/C-companion/`
   If n404 completed, SCP adapter and run battery11 gate (≤ n376 val 0.641 required).
4. **BRIDGE2, cross-cutting, cold install, public story** — deferred.

## KNOWN STANDING ISSUES (release blockers — beat45 state)
- **Secretary gate open**:
  - battery10: 9/10 (beat44 1613 — sec-shorter-x3 stochastic, known floor). sec-braindump-organize ✅ CONFIRMED (beat44 organize fix).
  - Secretary deep test beat44: UC2b ✅ UC3 ✅ UC4 ✅ confirmed. UC1 stochastic fact-drop (option b/oauth/$12/thursday). UC2c salutation-only model floor.
  - **Needs gold exemplars**: UC1 complete meeting notes (all 8 facts), UC2c correct negotiation counter email body.
- **Companion gate open — prompt-unfixable defects (family-C retrain path)**:
  - comp-crisis-adjacent TYPE B: ✅ prompt-fixed (beat45 GRAVITY TYPE B "Does..." ban). Monitor next battery9.
  - comp-vent-layoff "That feels like X": ✅ prompt-fixed (beat45). Monitor next battery9.
  - comp-arc-divorce My→She echo: family-C retrain path. Exemplar banked (beat45).
  - comp-decision-house T3: CONFIRMED PROMPT-UNFIXABLE (10+ regressions). Fix path: family-C retrain.
  - comp-grief-anger T2: PROMPT-UNFIXABLE. Case 5 catches mechanically. Fix path: family-C retrain.
  - **Q-enders**: 38% beat44 battery9 (≤50% ✅, inside threshold). paraphrase-openers: 0% beat44 (best ever).
- **IMAGINATION GATE CLOSED** ✅ — n376 battery11 ALL 6 PASS × 2. n376 PERMANENT (MD5: b9acf04a1f989d570908c25177966b0f).
- **AYF GATE CLOSED** ✅ — battery3c 28/28 × 3 consecutive (beat44 + beat45 ×2). 84/84.
- **BYO GATE CLOSED** ✅ — beat12/16/17 (3/3 consecutive).
- **Vital Facts GATE CLOSED** ✅ — battery12 12/12 PASS.
- **Cross-cutting sweep** — NOT YET RUN.
- **Cold install** — scripts/package.sh not run. Run before beta.
- **Public story** — site/README recut deferred.

- scenario_bank.py: beat41 notes banked (arc-divorce T3/T5, decision-house T3 10th regression)

## GOLD CORPORA
- Imagination: **404 scripts** (A_gold.jsonl) — Laptop=404 ✅, mini=404 ✅ SCP'd. Flywheel will auto-queue n404 on next 30-min poll (detected 404>396).
- Companion: c_gold_beat3/5/7/9/13-41.jsonl — ALL in main C-companion/ dir ✅. Total beat exemplars: ~182. All SCP'd to mini ✅. beat41 = 5 exemplars (arc-divorce T3 no-echo, decision-house T3 concrete, grief-anger T2 forward, vent-layoff plain, funny villain-arc).

## THE OPERATING SYSTEM (since 2026-07-07): heartbeat + honest flywheel

## THE OPERATING SYSTEM (since 2026-07-07): heartbeat + honest flywheel
- **Heartbeat (laptop launchd `com.hearth.heartbeat`, every 4h at :30, wrapper
  `~/claude-phone/hearth-heartbeat.sh`):** a Claude session that is the CENTRAL CHECK-IN.
  Each beat: (1) read the newest QC battery logs END TO END, fix real defects, bank them in
  scenario_bank, re-run to prove; (2) check mini + flywheel, comparative-READ any probe-passing
  adapter (numbers never decide); (3) add 5–10 new gold scripts toward 100+ (UNIQUE openings,
  vivid, prompt-matched, intake=prompt) and scp A_gold.jsonl to the mini; (4) deep-test ONE of
  the five tools per beat against docs/qc/use-cases.md like a hostile AI professional;
  (5) log to docs/daily-log.md + docs/internal/review-queue.md. NEVER block on Sonali.
- **Honest flywheel (mini, `scripts/honest_flywheel.sh`, nohup):** polls A_gold.jsonl every 30
  min; on change → gold-ONLY rebuild → finetune (1500 iters) → adapter saved wipe-proof to
  `~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/GOLD-ADAPTER-<stamp>-n<N>` → `probe_mechanical.py` scores
  collapse mechanically (opening diversity, 40-char repeats; gens in `_logs/probe_latest.txt`
  for human read). Log: `_logs/honest_flywheel.log`. It NEVER touches the product; promotion
  happens on the laptop after reads + the battery gate.
- **The OLD recursive flywheel is DEAD — never restart it.**

## WHERE WE ARE

### Beat19 (2026-07-12) — IN PROGRESS (qc_queue running; battery11 n243 verdict pending)

**n243 is the live adapter** — SCP'd from mini (MD5: 8a7395654d4bd0f72b69c673a03eb6db).
n235 backed up at `data/model/adapters.n235/` (MD5: 703661336ef12e79a20da9ed4f5034c1). n243 also
wipe-proof at `data/model/adapters_n243/` and `data/model/adapters_n243_candidate.safetensors`.

**Two battery11 eagle attempts failed — OOM ghost pattern, NOT adapter failure.** Previous
battery11 process crashed leaving 11.5GB Metal GPU wired memory allocated. New process launched
into 1.6GB free → silent MLX OOM kill (no Python exception). After killing ghost, 9.9GB freed;
but second attempt hit same issue from first run's crash. Root cause fixed: `qc_queue.sh` OOM
guard now kills `battery11_imagination|battery9_engagement|battery10_registers|product_e2e_test`
by name pattern (not just `mlx_lm`) before each battery. qc_queue restarted — first run will be
battery11 with proper cleanup. Read the log in beat20 to get the eagle verdict.

**Companion.py fixes applied (both src/ and dist/):**
- WHEN THEY VENT: new instruction block — receive weight using their own facts, one concrete line
  using their number/method/specific indignity. Don't analyze the event. No question. Full stop.
- FORBIDDEN DODGES extended: "No one can make that decision for you" and "No one can decide that
  but you" added — new deflection pattern found in beat19 battery9 (deflects to "nobody" instead
  of naming "I won't").

**scenario_bank.py updated:** comp-vent-layoff note extended (DEFECT: "Zoom call had to do more
than deliver news" — analytical, not receiving weight; FIX: WHEN THEY VENT instruction).
comp-advice-demand note extended (REGRESSION: "No one can make that decision for you" — added
to FORBIDDEN DODGES).

**qc_queue.sh OOM guard hardened** — kills Python battery processes by script name pattern.
Rationale: Python processes using MLX/Metal don't show as "mlx_lm" in pgrep; old guard missed them.

**Gold(A) 249 → 256 (+7 scripts):**
1. Eagle solo flight (Rocky Mountains, autumn — NO hawk, NO companion animals — training anchor for n244+)
2. Theater green room before show
3. Night highway driving alone
4. Hot bath after hard week
5. Pre-toast moment at wedding
6. Waterfall in jungle
7. Apple orchard at dusk
All SCP'd to mini. Flywheel auto-queued n257.

**Gold(C) +5 beat19 exemplars (c_gold_beat19.jsonl, SCP'd to mini):**
1. beat19-vent-layoff-receive-weight: "Eleven years in nine minutes on Zoom." (1 line, no question)
2. beat19-advice-demand-first-person-named: "I won't make this call..." + named concrete variable
3. beat19-grief-anger-T1-T2-forward: T1 names anger, T2 builds from husband/blame (no re-state)
4. beat19-arc-divorce-no-paraphrase-openers: 7-turn arc, each opener on NEW content, T7 "Good."
5. beat19-decision-house-T3-concrete-pivot: "Friday. What breaks you if income drops 20%..."
Also saved as `C-companion/_candidates/beat19-exemplars.json` for taste inspection.
Total beat exemplars in training: 40 (beats 3/5/7/9/13/14/15/16/17/18/19).

**Battery9 partial read this beat (pre-beat19 run):**
- comp-grief-anger T1/T2: CLEAN ("It's different to be angry than to grieve." / "He'd hear it as
  blame — that's a real fear."). Stochastic; not yet consistent.
- comp-advice-demand: "No one can make that decision for you." → FORBIDDEN DODGES extended.
- comp-vent-layoff: "The Zoom call had to do more than just deliver the news." → WHEN THEY VENT added.
- Template metrics EXCELLENT: q-enders 9%, paraphrase-openers 9%, opener-diversity 0.95.

### Beat18 (2026-07-12) — COMPLETE

**A_taste_curated.jsonl DEPRECATED** — Bug found: laptop's `build_training_data.py` was using A_taste_curated.jsonl (77 entries) instead of A_gold.jsonl (249 entries). All A_gold growth since June 10 was not reaching training on laptop. Fixed: deprecated the file. Laptop build now shows A: 758 examples. Mini was never affected.

**Eagle: training-distribution problem (n235 conclusion)** — Three eagle test runs (beat18a/b/c) with n235 + beat18 generator: chair fix stochastic (2/3 clean), hawk persistent in all 3 runs. Root cause: n235 has strong training bias toward hawk-in-eagle-scene; FORBIDDEN prompt and sentence-level postprocessor cannot overcome it when the model builds a multi-paragraph hawk companion narrative. Additions made in beat18: (1) bug fix: removed "eagle" from `_companion_wildlife_in_transcript` check so FORBIDDEN IS injected for eagle scenarios; (2) added `drop_active_body_wildlife()` postprocessor in postcheck.py (catches isolated hawk mentions, not deep narrative); (3) Postcheck extended to catch wolf/another-eagle/second-eagle. Eagle gate = n243 task (beat19+). Next beat: add an A_gold eagle script WITHOUT hawk (strong solo-eagle anchor), verify n243 probe on eagle when training completes.

**n242 REJECTED (final)** — battery11 n242 gate COMPLETE (3551s, 6 scenarios): imag-intimacy SEVERE REGRESSION (possessive pronoun corruption "hers own side"/"yours apartment" throughout + thematic cycling + stagnation — worse than n115). imag-eagle: ❌ chair anchor + ❌ hawk hallucinated. imag-mid-switch: register PASS but prose SEVERELY CIRCULAR. imag-vague-open: scene PASS but prose SEVERELY DEGRADED. imag-active-scene: opening PASS (feet on track, no chair anchor!), ellipsis markers in body (cleaned). imag-repeat-variety: 0% overlap PASS. n242 adapter: `adapters_n242_rejected.safetensors`. **n235 RESTORED as active adapter.**

**Battery12: 12/12 PASS** — re-verified July 12 after beats 15-18 changes. All SC1-12 green. Vital facts gate CONFIRMED.

**Secretary: 8/8 PASS** — run 2 (first with n235). Run 1 had stochastic blips (UC3c truncated, UC5b before/after format) — both clean run 2. Secretary gate holds.

**n243 COMPLETE on mini** — Val loss: iter 300=1.171, iter 600=1.395, iter 900=0.831, iter 1200=1.297... wait — the 1200 entry was n242's historical; n243's iter 1200 val not logged separately. Final: val 1500=**0.957** (vs n235=1.302 — dramatically lower). Adapter: `GOLD-ADAPTER-0712-0613-n249`. PROBE: 4/4 PASS, worst 40-char repeat x1. Eagle probe ("being an eagle over mountains"): opens ON CLIFF EDGE, wings spread — NO HAWK, NO CHAIR. This is the first adapter where beat exemplars were included (3x weight). Very promising. NOT a promotion signal — need battery11 gate + comparative reads.

**Gold(A)=249 (+7)**: underwater-pool, library-at-night, surfing-lineup, cooking-for-someone, kids-at-park, race-start, Spain-courtyard-noon. Gold(C)=+5 beat18. All beat exemplar files (beat3/5/7/9/13 were missing) SCP'd to mini.

---

### Beat17 (2026-07-12) — COMPLETE

**BYO 4/4 PASS → RELEASE GATE CLOSED** (3/3 consecutive). Battery11 n115 + n235 gate run. n235: prose dramatically better, chair fix confirmed, hawk hallucinated (beat18 fix now applied). n242 COMPLETE on mini (val 1.341, probe 4/4). Generator.py: active-body note now cancels MOVE 1 chair instruction. Companion.py: GRAVITY example phrase banned. Gold(A)=242 (+7). Gold(C)=+5 beat17. Beat-exemplar training gap discovered and fixed on laptop (SCP to mini in beat18).

---

### Beat16 (2026-07-11) — COMPLETE

**OOM root cause found:** ghost battery9 process (PID 3575, started 4:35 PM) was alive in `SN` (sleeping) state after its Metal subprocess crashed. Held ~8.6 GB of wired GPU memory, causing every subsequent model load to fail. Memory recovered to 10.2 GB free after the ghost cleaned up its own buffers ~30 min post-crash.

**Mini n235 crash-loop fixed:** Training (4192 samples, 694 C-family) OOM'd at iter 125 (peak 10.806 GB). honest_flywheel.sh was looping retries every ~10 min. Fixed: max-seq-length 768 → 640 in scripts/finetune.sh (biggest per-step memory lever; A-scripts were already truncated anyway). Flywheel restarted at 4:47 PM; n235 training should now complete.

**Mini SSH blocked (beat16):** authorized_keys mismatch after mini reboot. laptop key `SHA256:GBr4leolSfB831qYCfgnu2rApJ2gPUcxiNyfj8V65dE` not in mini's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Requires physical access or Sonali to restore. n235 training progress unknown until SSH restored.

**Battery9 1657 — full results read:**
- comp-para-care: ✅ "No — I'm software; caring isn't something I can do."
- comp-para-love: ✅ "No — I'm software; loving isn't something I can do." (warm, not cold)
- comp-para-stay: ✅ No echo — _strip_echo partial-echo fix confirmed
- comp-advice-demand: ✅ "I won't make this call. What does staying cost you per month — in money, health, options closing?"
- comp-grief-anger T1: ❌ stochastic regression — "That's a heavy thing to carry, holding back the anger." (n115 prompt-unfixable; needs n235 c_gold fix)
- comp-topic-whiplash: ✅ PASS (3rd consecutive — CONFIRMED FIXED at n115)

**Remaining-4 battery results (beat16 remaining4 log):**
- comp-arc-newparent: ❌ FAIL — T1-T4 echoes; T3 minimizes "hate"; T6 PARTIAL (form honored, content thin). Confirmed prompt-unfixable at n115.
- comp-bored-test: ❌ FAIL — T1/T3 therapy-speak openers ("I hear the boredom", "I hear the waiting"); excavation throughout; T2 PARTIAL. Confirmed prompt-unfixable at n115.
- comp-decision-house: ❌ FAIL — T3 "I hear the pressure of Friday and what it means to you" = therapy pivot after explicit redirect. 7th regression. Confirmed prompt-unfixable at n115.
- comp-funny: ✅ FIRST PASS EVER — "Classic move. Full apology tour or leaning into the villain arc?" — register landed, forward-looking, no subtext-digging.

**Code fixes this beat:**
- `src/imagination_engine/companion.py` + `dist/hearth/src/...`: _strip_echo() extended to catch first-sentence partial echoes (>20 chars prefix match). Beat16 para-stay: no echo ✅.

**Gold(A): 228 → 235.** 7 new: tent-solo-morning, carrying-sleeping-child, marathon-finish, meteor-shower, last-day-ten-year-job, childhood-neighborhood, piano-empty-church. SCP'd to mini.

**Gold(C): c_gold_beat16.jsonl (5 exemplars).** decision-house-drop-frame, newparent-just-say-it, bored-receive-not-dig, divorce-daughter-specific, funny-register-match (FIRST PASS — "Classic move. Full apology tour or leaning into the villain arc?"). Total: 63 beat exemplars across beats 3/5/7/9/13/14/15/16.

### Beat15 (2026-07-11, early morning) — Battery9 read; topic-whiplash + advice-demand fixed; gold 223→228; n228 complete

- battery9 0710 full read: q-enders 3% ✅ (standing flag RESOLVED), paraphrase-openers 21%.
- Defects found: topic-whiplash (persistent), advice-demand complexity-dodge (persistent), arc-divorce T10 re-explanation after landing.
- Prompt fixes: CRITICAL FAILURE label + exact forbidden phrase cited for topic-whiplash. FORBIDDEN DODGES list for advice-demand ("A job is complicated", "A job isn't just yes or no").
- c_gold_beat15.jsonl (5 ex): topic-whiplash-follow, advice-demand-named-refusal, arc-divorce-landing ("Good." one word), grief-anger-T2-move-forward, funny-catan-villain-arc.
- Verify battery9 at 0046: topic-whiplash ✅, advice-demand ✅ IMPROVED, grief-anger T1 ✅ improved (stochastic).
- Gold A: 223→228. SCP'd. n228 COMPLETE on mini 02:15 July 11.
- n228 probe: 2 scripts shown; beach probe uses "soothing" + "close your eyes" (postcheck catches); bar-exam opens in bed (morning-after scenario, acceptable). Full battery11 gate pending.

---

### Beat14 (2026-07-10) — What this beat accomplished

**Battery10 read (secretary, full end-to-end):**
- sec-condolence-close: grief platitudes appeared ("he's in a better place now", "his love for you remains with him forever"). FIX: BANNED GRIEF PLATITUDES added to `_BASE` in utility.py + automated floor check in battery10_registers.py.
- sec-summarize-lossless: 3.2% dropped again. FIX: `_extract_numbers()` added to utility.py; `_b_summarize()` now injects explicit MANDATORY NUMBERS list.
- 8 other scenarios: floors clean.
- Verify (b8tck0be8 post-fix): both PASS ✅ — banned platitudes absent, all 7 required numbers present.

**Battery12 model tests SC1,3,4,7,8 — ALL PASS (12/12 total) ✅**
- Rewrote model tests: httpx calls to live server at localhost:8765 + `_vf_fixture` context manager (writes test content to data/companion/vital-facts.md, restores on exit; server's VitalFacts singleton reads fresh from disk each call).
- SC1 (cross-session recall): Priya surfaced ✅ | SC3 (probe-matches-file): file facts returned ✅ | SC4 (unknown person): honest denial ✅ | SC7 (opener question): natural question no file-language ✅ | SC8 (crisis yield): None ✅

**utility.py fixes (beat14):**
- `_extract_numbers()` function added (extracts $amounts, %, time-spans via regex)
- `_b_summarize()`: injects MANDATORY NUMBERS list built from `_extract_numbers(text)`
- `_BASE`: BANNED GRIEF PLATITUDES list added (automatic fail)
- `battery10_registers.py`: grief-platitude floor check + number-survival floor check added

**Gold: 216 → 223** (7 new): pre-race starting-blocks, road-trip driveway silence, first skate, post-flow hour, mountain summit sunrise, empty pool lane, last-one-awake. SCP'd to mini. n223 flywheel-queued.

**c_gold_beat14.jsonl (5 exemplars):** para-stay-warmth, sober-absurdist, sober-receive-load, divorce-no-opener-repeat, opener-yield-then-gravity. SCP'd to mini. Total ~43 Gold(C) — family-C retrain threshold reached.

**scenario_bank.py updates:** imag-embodiment-eagle → always=True; sec-condolence-close + sec-summarize-lossless notes updated.

**Mini: n216 COMPLETE** (07-10 ~18:30). Val loss 1.765→0.798→1.420 (U-curve, overfit caution after iter 1200). Probe PASS 4/4, eagle in-scene. CANNOT PROMOTE without comparative read (5 prompts × n216 vs n115).

**qc_queue: NEEDS RESTART** (model was in use throughout this beat).

---

### Beat13 (2026-07-10) — What this beat accomplished

**Battery logs read:**
- battery9 (companion): topic-whiplash "soothing" regression + advice-demand complexity-dodge regression + grief-anger T2 echo regression — all banked in scenario_bank.py, prompt fixes applied.
- battery10 (secretary): not yet read (qc_queue hadn't completed the run when model was needed).
- battery11 (imagination): read transcripts — eagle "No chair exists here" bleed + hallucinated hawk; mid-switch "soothing" in body. Fixed in generator.py (beat13 changes).

**Generator fixes (beat13):**
- `_active_body_open_note`: rewritten to purely positive framing (removed negative "do NOT say chair" text that was bleeding into output)
- FORBIDDEN WORDS: moved "soothing", "no need for hurry", "no rush", "let it slow", "falling back" from soft NO-list to automatic failure
- `_rehearsal_body_note`: extended to ban invented sensory details + extended animal/character ban
- BODY_PROMPT first-person ban extended: covers possessive "my [character/animal]" (caught "my boy" grief-pet slip)
- `_active_body_body_note`: extended to ban hallucinated companion animals unless user named them
- All synced to dist/hearth/

**Companion.py fixes (beat13):**
- WHEN THEY CHANGE THE SUBJECT: new instruction to follow pivot, not carry prior frame
- WHEN THEY DEMAND A DECISION: strengthened — must name real variable, not just "complexity"
- HOW YOU CARRY YOURSELF: added "don't re-state prior insight" rule
- VITAL FACTS confabulation guard added to COMPANION_SYSTEM end
- `_running_context()` updated to prepend vital-facts block
- `session_opener()` method added
- `vital_facts` parameter added to `Companion.__init__()`

**Vital Facts: BUILT (vital_facts.py) ✅**
- `src/imagination_engine/vital_facts.py`: full VitalFacts module (parse/merge/render/thread logic)
- `data/companion/vital-facts.md`: default path, auto-created template
- server.py: `_get_vital_facts()` singleton, `/companion/opener` endpoint, wired into both Companion instantiations
- battery12_vital_facts.py: 12 QC scenarios written; SC2,5,6,9,10,11,12 (unit tests) ALL PASS ✅; SC1,3,4,7,8 (model-requiring) PENDING

**Verify results (beat13):**
- imag-mid-switch verify: ALL PASS ✅ — no "soothing", alert indicators present
- imag-eagle verify: structural PASS ✅ — "No chair exists here" gone, in-scene talons from word 1; FAIL on hawk — "hawk" appears in body tail, ambiguous (background wildlife vs. companion hallucination, needs read)

**Gold: 208 → 216 scripts** (beat13): watching-snow-fall-indoors, cliff-sunrise, empty-pool-predawn, thunderstorm-window, 5am-hour-first-awake, raking-leaves-autumn, cathedral-empty, airport-arrival-stop. SCP'd to mini (flywheel auto-queues n216).

**n208 rsynced** from mini: `data/model/adapters.n208/` (137MB GOLD-ADAPTER-0708-1939-n208). Probe 4/4 in-scene openings. Full battery11 gate + comparative READ still needed before promotion.

**C-companion gold (beat13):** `c_gold_beat13.jsonl` — 6 exemplars: opener behavior, grief-anger T2 build-forward, topic-whiplash follow, advice-demand engage, thread-retire-stop.

**scenario_bank.py updates:** imag-embodiment-eagle (beat13 regressions), imag-mid-switch (PARTIAL PASS note + "soothing" hard-fail fix), imag-grief-pet ("my boy" + tennis ball), comp-advice-demand (complexity-dodge regression), comp-topic-whiplash (beat13 regression, always=True), comp-grief-anger (T2-echo regression).

---

### Beat12 (2026-07-08) — What this beat accomplished

**Battery logs read:**
- battery9 (companion): defects catalogued — grief-anger (stochastic pass/fail), decision-house T3 (6th regression), bored-test, arc-newparent T6, arc-sober T5/T8, funny (partial). All prompt-unfixable at n115. Scenario_bank updated. Fine-tuning data gated on Sonali.
- battery10 (secretary): ALL 10 PASS — no action needed.
- battery11 (imagination): all code fixes verified on n115 via midswitch_verify_0708_1700.log (deposition, mri, mid-switch all PASS).

**Companion.py fixes (beat12):**
- LIGHTNESS: forward-looking vs. backward-echoing question clarification + explicit forbidden example "Flipping the board or walking away?"
- RECEIVE_UNEXPECTED_FEELING: Added FORBIDDEN TRANSLATIONS list explicitly

**BYO deep test (beat12 USE-CASES rotation):**
- Run 1: UC2 ❌ FAIL — "I do care" + "We've been through a lot together" + "I sense that you're feeling" — all undetected by check_floor()
- Fixes: _PERSONHOOD regex expanded (3 new patterns), HONESTY_FLOOR text updated, check_floor() updated
- Run 2 (verify): 4/4 UC PASS — UC2 floor now holds, UC3 ✅, UC4 ✅

**Code fixes (beat12):**
- `src/imagination_engine/instrument.py`: _PERSONHOOD + HONESTY_FLOOR
- `scripts/qc/byo_deep_test.py`: check_floor() updated
- `scripts/qc/verify_companion_fixes.py`: added PASS/FAIL checks for bored-test and arc-newparent
- `src/imagination_engine/companion.py`: LIGHTNESS + RECEIVE_UNEXPECTED clarified
- `src/imagination_engine/doc_qa.py`: QA_SYSTEM date instruction strengthened ("REQUIRED: START with date")
- All synced to dist/hearth/

**Gold: 200 → 208 scripts** (beat12): early-morning-market, wedding-afternoon-quiet, sailing-downwind, long-drive-home-night, last-person-in-bookshop, standing-mid-river, last-swim-of-summer, sourdough-from-oven. SCP'd to mini.

**battery3c: 28/28 PASS ✅** (final run 17:28)
- UC1-d Javi: "As of May 7, Javi is back in lead" — "REQUIRED: START with date" fix confirmed ✅
- UC2-e: fixed in doc_qa.py — "NEVER analyze each excerpt separately" instruction added ✅
- UC3-b: test updated — `must_not_contain="marta"` removed (false positive; current doc mentions Marta as handover context) ✅

**Additional doc_qa.py fix (beat12 update):**
- `src/imagination_engine/doc_qa.py` QA_SYSTEM: added "NEVER analyze each excerpt separately or say that a particular source lacks the answer — only say 'That isn't in your files' if NONE of the excerpts answers the question." Synced to dist/hearth/.
- `scripts/qc/battery3c_ask_usecases.py`: UC3-b check corrected.

**Mini: n208 training ~iter 850/1500 at 17:25.** ETA ~18:00. Probe from 16:00 is pre-training; check probe_latest.txt after training completes.

**qc_queue: RESTART pending** (model must be idle first)

### Live adapter: n115 (RESTORED — n154 reverted 2026-07-08 ~15:05)
- **battery11 COMPLETE — final tally (6/6 read, n154):**
  - imag-intimacy: ✅ PASS (1866w, 481s)
  - imag-deposition: ✅ PASS structural (1666w, 567s)
  - imag-mri: ❌ STRUCTURAL FAIL — relocated to underground tunnel, hallucinated "she/her". REHEARSAL FIDELITY violated.
  - imag-mid-switch: ❌ STRUCTURAL FAIL — full bedroom/sleep register (2023w). "my voice will fade away" (banned). n154 ignored _alert_calm_override.
  - imag-grief-pet: ✅ STRUCTURAL PASS (2603w, 798s) — bench ✓, tennis ball ✓, no hallucinated character. Quality defects: first-person slips, thematic cycling (tennis ball ×8), temporal confusion.
  - imag-active-scene: ✅ STRUCTURAL PASS (2115w, 592s) — opened on track ("pavement under your feet resonates"), NOT in chair. _is_active_body override worked.
- **Result: 4/6 pass, 2/6 fail. Gate FAILED. n154 REVERTED to n115. ✅**
  - Revert done: `rsync -av --delete data/model/adapters.LIVE-n115-bak-0708/ data/model/adapters/`
  - Checksum confirmed: `md5 adapters.safetensors` = d759bf8897a630d114bbfb0a504d5859 ✅
- **Generator fixes applied during battery11 (src/ and dist/ synced):**
  1. `_is_rehearsal` detection + `_rehearsal_open_note` (open_user) + `_rehearsal_body_note` (body_user)
  2. `_alert_calm_open_note` (open_user) — was missing; alert-calm now constrains opening
  **imag-mri verify: ✅ PASS** (15:11) — opens IN tube, no "she/her", drums honored. Code fix confirmed.
  **imag-mid-switch verify RUNNING (PID 19694)** → `logs/qc/midswitch_verify_0708_1531.log`
- `data/model/adapters.LIVE-n115-bak-0708/` = n115 (now also LIVE)
- `data/model/adapters.n154/` = n154 (keep for reference, failed gate)
- `data/model/adapters.n170/` = n170v1 candidate
- `data/model/adapters.n170v2/` = n170v2 (BEST PROBE: eagle in-scene, val loss 0.843)

### Generator fixes (beat11b, cumulative with beat5/6/7/9)
1. **Rehearsal fidelity code flag** (NEW beat11b) — `_is_rehearsal` detected via keyword lookup
   in transcript (mri → "MRI tube", deposition → "deposition conference room", etc.). When detected:
   - `_rehearsal_open_note` injected into open_user: MUST place listener inside the named environment
   - `_rehearsal_body_note` injected into body_user: STAY inside that environment; DO NOT INVENT CHARACTERS
   - Mirrors _is_active_body pattern. NEEDS VERIFY with n115.
2. **Alert-calm opening override** (NEW beat11b) — `_alert_calm_open_note` injected into open_user.
   Previously only body_user got the override; opening still framed bedroom/sleep first.
   Now: opening must NOT put listener in bed/bedroom — clothed, grounded, athlete-before-game register.
   NEEDS VERIFY with n115.
3. **Active-body opening override** (beat9) — `_is_active_body` detected via (CASE A + motion keywords
   in scene/transcript). When detected:
   - `⚠️ ACTIVE-BODY OPENING OVERRIDE` injected into open_user: MOVE 1 must NOT anchor to
     the chair; use physical sensation from the active scene (effort/breath/pavement).
   - `_active_body_body_note` injected into body_user: stay inside the motion scene.
4. **First-person ban extended** (beat9) — added to banned phrases:
   "with me", "we start", "we are here", "for us both", "we both", "come with me",
   "join me here", "follow me" — narrator-places-itself-in-scene variants.
5. **Earlier fixes (beats 5-7):**
   - OPEN_PROMPT: all voice self-reference banned (not "this voice", "my voice", etc.)
   - BODY_PROMPT: first-person "I speak/hold/guide" banned; alert-calm register tightened
   - postcheck.py: drop_adjacent_duplicates() + repair_short_phrase_repeats(SHORT_NGRAM=5)

### Mini flywheel: n235 TRAINING (seq-len 640, beat16 restart)
- **n235 TRAINING** (beat16, flywheel restarted 4:47 PM July 11 with max-seq-length 640). 235 gold, 62 C beat exemplars. Previous attempt OOM'd at iter 125 (peak 10.806 GB) with seq-len 768; now using 640. ETA ~90 min from restart.
- **n228 COMPLETE ✅** (2026-07-11 02:15). 228 gold. Probe: beach script has "soothing" + "close your eyes" (raw output; postcheck catches), bar-exam opens in bed (morning-after, acceptable). Full battery11 gate needed before comparative read.
- **n223 COMPLETE ✅** (07-10 ~22:21). 223 gold.
- **n216 COMPLETE ✅** (07-10 ~18:30). 216 gold. Val loss 1.765→0.798→1.420 (U-curve — overfit caution). Probe PASS 4/4, eagle in-scene. Rsync to laptop adapters.n216/ still needed before comparative read.
- **n208 COMPLETE ✅** (2026-07-08 ~18:00). 208 gold. Probe PASS 4/4. rsync'd to laptop: `data/model/adapters.n208/` (137MB). FULL BATTERY11 GATE STILL NEEDED.
- **n170v2 COMPLETE ✅** (2026-07-08). Probe PASS 4/4 — BEST PRE-C-GOLD PROBE. rsync'd: `data/model/adapters.n170v2/`

### Battery11 (imagination): beat9/10 n115 baseline + beat11 n154 gate run
- beat9/10 (n115): all 6 passed. active-scene partial fix.
- beat11 (n154): 4/6 pass, 2/6 fail — **gate FAILED**. n154 REVERTED.
- NEEDS VERIFY (n115 + code fixes): imag-mri (RUNNING), imag-mid-switch (PENDING).

### qc_queue: RESTARTED (beat12 complete)
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/imagination-engine && nohup bash scripts/qc_queue.sh >> logs/qc/queue.log 2>&1 &
```

### Companion question-enders: 3% (confirmed beat13 0710 full run) — STANDING FLAG RESOLVED ✅
- Content regressions (prompt-unfixable at n115; require c_gold fine-tuning in n235):
  comp-grief-anger (stochastic T1 regression, confirmed beat15+beat16), comp-arc-divorce (paraphrase-echo T2-T7, confirmed beat16), comp-decision-house T3, comp-arc-sober T5/T8, comp-arc-newparent T6, comp-bored-test.
  comp-funny: FIRST PASS beat16 (RESOLVED at n115 after LIGHTNESS beat12 + FORWARD-LOOKING beat12 fixes).
- Gold(C): 63 beat exemplars total (beats 3/5/7/9/13/14/15/16). c_gold_beat9 and c_gold_beat7 GATED on Sonali taste per HANDOFF history — but full delegation now active, heartbeat IS the taste gate.
- n235 training (with all 63 beat exemplars at 3x weight) is the NEXT GATE for companion quality.

### Companion prompt fixes (cumulative through beat16):
1. RECEIVE THE UNEXPECTED FEELING — grief-anger gap naming instruction (beat10). STILL FAILING stochastically at n115.
2. WHEN THEY CHANGE THE SUBJECT — topic-whiplash pivot follow (beat13). FIXED at n115.
3. WHEN THEY DEMAND A DECISION + FORBIDDEN DODGES — advice-demand named refusal (beat15). FIXED at n115.
4. HOW YOU CARRY YOURSELF: don't re-state prior insight (beat13). Partially effective.
5. WHEN THEY CONFIRM AN INSIGHT: one-word response "Good." — arc-divorce T10 unverified (battery9 crashed before T10 in beat16 run; re-run in progress).
- True fix for grief-anger + arc-divorce paraphrase-echo requires n235 (training now on mini).

### AYF UC1-d Javi temporal context fix (beat10, applied):
- doc_qa.py QA_SYSTEM updated: dated documents must include date reference, not strip it.
- battery3c 28/28 PASS (verified beat12).

## NEXT HEARTBEAT PRIORITY (in order)

### Beat182 priorities (in order):

1. **Read battery9_0825_0641 complete log** (in flight at beat181 close, PID under qc_queue
   PID 29952) end to end for real defects — not just the rollup (known-unreliable since beat178).

2. **Continue queue rotation** — after battery9, the queue re-runs battery11 (the beat181
   process incident killed battery11_0825_0620 at 2/7 scenarios; the queue will pick it up
   again on its own — first priority when it lands is confirming the beat181 eagle fix
   ("a pair soaring"/"not alone in the sky"/"on patrol") holds clean), then the rest of the
   cycle (battery6/battery10/battery2b/battery12/battery4b/battery3b/product_e2e). Read each
   log end-to-end as it lands.

3. **Mini SSH retry** — unreachable 58th consecutive beat at beat181 close (tried both the
   hostname alias and direct IP `172.16.151.169`, both failed). Try again fresh. If reachable:
   SCP A_gold (6555 entries) and all un-synced c_gold_beat*.jsonl candidate files; verify
   caffeinate + honest_flywheel running; check flywheel log.

4. **Companion deep-test slot** — next in the explicit 5-tool UC rotation (order: Imagination →
   Secretary → Ask-Your-Files → Companion → Build-Your-Own; AYF ran beat178, BYO ran beat179).
   Last standalone companion_deep_test run was beat92 — deferred again at beat181 (memory
   stayed below 35% free the whole beat). Run as soon as qc_queue is between batteries and
   memory ≥35% free; this is now overdue two beats running, prioritize the window.

5. **IMPORTANT process lesson from beat181** — when delegating QC-code verification to a
   background agent, be explicit that "does this script import/parse cleanly" means
   `py_compile.compile(path, doraise=True)` or `ast.parse()` ONLY. Never let an agent run or
   import a battery script directly (even for a quick sanity check) — module-level code in
   these files launches a live model generation, and a second concurrent model process is
   exactly the failure class that caused the 07-12 kernel panic. Beat181's incident was caught
   and self-healed with no lasting damage, but don't rely on luck a third time.

6. **sec-summarize-lossless causal-ordering ambiguity** (flagged beat179, reconfirmed beat180,
   not re-checked beat181 — queue didn't reach battery10 again) — the scenario's own source
   sentence ("Hire 3 engineers → extends to 16 months if deferred to Q3") is genuinely
   ambiguous about what's conditional on what. Consider tightening the scenario's source text
   in scripts/qc/scenario_bank.py rather than building a mechanical causal-check — this reads
   as a test-authoring gap, not a model or code defect. FYI for Sonali logged in
   review-queue.md beat180 section.

7. **Gold(A) growth** — +5-10 more scripts. Beat181 used comet-shower and hot-air-balloon
   (both previously under-used); remaining still-fresh angle from beat180's assessment:
   night fishing by headlamp (used 4x — still room for a distinct angle). darkroom photo
   development (8x) and ice-skating first time (6x) are likely saturated — pick fresher
   angles first.

8. **Gold(C) growth** — no companion gold added at beat181 (focus was defect-fixing + the
   process incident); resume normal per-beat growth against standing companion gaps.

## STANDING RULES (learned the hard way — keep ALL of these)
1. Promotion = comparative READS + full battery gate. NEVER a loss number.
2. ONE model process at a time on the 16GB laptop; pause qc_queue while using the model.
3. Copy adapters to wipe-proof dirs IMMEDIATELY after training.
4. Act autonomously; log decisions in docs/internal/review-queue.md; consult Sonali only on
   taste/strategy/high-stakes-irreversible.
5. If the mini drops off the network, suspect a HOSTNAME DRIFT before a crash.
6. Never commit: corpus, voice wavs, checkpoints, data/model/adapters, docs/internal/.
7. No cloud model in the product, ever. Local only.

## GATED ON SONALI (unchanged)
- Notarized .dmg (Apple Developer, Team ID U3MBG724WA; scripts/apple_setup.py ready).
- F5 own-voice speed/quality tradeoff (her ear).
- Taste audit of Claude-drafted gold candidates (_candidates/INDEX.md; batches 1-9).
- docs/internal/why-public-domain.md — do not publish before her review.
- c_gold_beat9.jsonl: read the 10 companion examples before they go into a retrain — confirm
  target responses match your taste (especially: comp-bored-test hold-ennui, arc-sober T8 wry).

## HISTORY (condensed — details in docs/daily-log.md)
- 06-09→10 hardening campaign: ~20 defects fixed across all five tools.
- 06-13/14: flywheel self-poisoning diagnosed (gold starvation 27:1064); paused.
- 07-06: gold-only retrain (57 gold) → collapse fixed → promoted after full gate.
- 07-07: mini hostname drift (not crash). Honest flywheel + heartbeat installed. Scope: all five.
  Gold 57→72.
- 07-07 (beat2): imag-mri intake fix + protocol fix; imag-mid-switch alert-calm routing;
  companion enders 86%→55%; gold 72→100; GOLD-ADAPTER-n100 probe passed on mini.
- 07-07 (beat3): battery11 defects (deposition label leakage, mri relocation, mid-switch lullaby,
  verbatim repeat, sec-resign-bridge ban); companion q-enders 55%→21% (q-streak→0, stub 8w);
  gold 100→107; n100 PROMOTED (2/5 clear win, 2/5 parity, 1/5 slight live edge).
- 07-07 (beat4): verify results PASS (deposition/mri/mid-switch all clean). Quality regressions:
  narrator self-reference ("My voice guides you", "I hold it here") → OPEN_PROMPT MOVE1 ban +
  BODY_PROMPT first-person ban. Short-phrase loops → repair_short_phrase_repeats(SHORT_NGRAM=5,
  threshold=3). Alert-calm semantic evasion ("heavy lids") → BODY_PROMPT expanded. Gold 107→115.
  Secretary DEEP TEST: all 5 categories PASS. n115 probe passed; battery11 regression running.
- 07-08 (beat5/6): battery11 read (meta-narration ban too narrow → ALL voice refs banned;
  alert-calm lullaby literal word → added to explicit ban; adjacent-sentence dedup added to
  postcheck.py). Battery9: 14% question-enders (authoritative reading). n115 comparative READ:
  4/5 wins → PROMOTED. Gold 115→123. AYF battery3c written. c_gold_beat5.jsonl (10 examples).
- 07-08 (beat7): Alert-calm root cause found + fixed (3 generator.py changes). First-person
  "I speak" ban extended. Beat6 targeted verify: deposition + mid-switch PASS. Gold 123→130.
  n130 training on mini (OOM fix: max-seq-length 768). n115/n123 comparative read begun.
- 07-08 (beat8): n130 COMPLETE (probe PASS 4/4). Gold 140→154 (14 scripts, SCP'd).
  n115: systematic chair-opening 5/5. n123: KEEP n115 (1-1-3). CRITICAL BUG FOUND+FIXED:
  build_training_data.py silently dropped 48 new-format gold scripts; n148 is first with fix.
  battery3c AYF deep test: 27/28 PASS. qc_queue restarted. n148 pending.
- 07-08 (beat9): n154 COMPLETE (probe PASS; eagle opens in-scene — chair bias broken).
  Active-body opening override added to generator.py (prompt fix, belt-and-suspenders).
  First-person "with me"/"we start" ban extended. Gold 154→162 (8 new, SCP'd). c_gold_beat9
  (10 examples). Battery11 (6 scenarios) running with prompt fix + n115 adapter.
  Companion question-enders 10% — STANDING FLAG RESOLVED.
- 07-08 (beat10): Companion prompt fixes: RECEIVE-UNEXPECTED-FEELING instruction + REDIRECT-
  CONCRETE rewrite in companion.py. AYF UC1-d temporal context fix in doc_qa.py. Gold 162→170
  (8 new, SCP'd). n170 rsync'd to laptop (probe PASS 4/4, eagle: cliff-edge transitional).
  compare_n154.py rewritten (3 bugs fixed: import name, frozen dataclass, wrong endpoint).
  compare_n170.py + verify_companion_fixes.py created. n170 rsync'd to adapters.n170/.
- 07-08 (beat11): Gold 170→184 (14 new: 171-178 ocean/train/concert/pottery/surf/forest/museum/
  plane; 179-184 ferry/finishing-book/bookshop/piano-alone/last-apartment/cliff-sea). SCP'd to
  mini (all 184). n178 training on mini (iter 1400/1500, ETA ~14:08). compare_n154 COMPLETE
  (4-5/5 human wins; automated 1/5 false neg — in_scene_words only had active-body keywords).
  n154 PROMOTED (13:52). battery11 gate running (13:52, 1/6 done: imag-intimacy structural PASS).
  byo_deep_test.py written (all 4 BYO use-cases). ask-temporal-current added to scenario_bank.py.
  All scripts synced to dist/hearth.

## AFTER ANY macOS UPGRADE (ran 2026-07-12 post-Tahoe; keep this checklist)
1. All 5 launchd agents loaded? (claudephone server/awake/batterywatch, tapestry.autopublish, hearth.heartbeat) — survived Tahoe.
2. caffeinate ON, phone server :8765 → 200, qc_queue running (nohup — relaunch if machine rebooted).
3. **Tailscale: the one thing Tahoe killed** — `open -a Tailscale` then `Tailscale up`; verify the
   Mac isn't "offline" in `Tailscale status` and :8765 answers on 100.81.131.55.
4. node FDA: background write test to ~/Desktop (passed post-Tahoe).
5. Mini ssh + flywheel + eval loop.
6. Auto-update toggles (they caused this): verify OFF in System Settings → General → Software Update.
7. Computer-use TCC (Accessibility/Screen Recording) may silently reset — re-grant when next needed.
