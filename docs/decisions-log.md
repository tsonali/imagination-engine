# Decisions Log

A running record of decisions and their reasoning. Append a new entry whenever a decision is made or changed. This keeps the *why* from getting lost as the project evolves.

## Initial decisions (project setup)

**Product is a local-first guided-imagination tool, not a generative-video product.**
The imagery happens in the user's mind; the product generates words and voice. This is truer to the underlying mechanism (mental rehearsal / guided imagery) and avoids dependence on expensive, cloud-bound frontier video models. Reason: fidelity to the therapeutic mechanism + local-first economics align.

**Modality is audio-led, internally-imaged.** Text core (reasoning) drives a local TTS voice layer. Reason: voice is the modality where high-quality, on-device, zero-marginal-cost generation is genuinely achievable now; and guided imagery is traditionally and effectively audio-led.

**Local-first, no cloud inference, no token meter, fully private.** All model and TTS inference runs on the user's device; no user content leaves the machine. Reason: this is the core trust proposition for a product holding the user's inner life, and the central differentiator versus anything the large model companies would ship.

**v0 is ONE template: future-self visualization.** Other protocols are deferred. Reason: build concrete first; the flexible multi-template "platform" is extracted later from real templates, not designed up front.

**Future-self visualization chosen as the first template (over grief/trauma/exposure).** Reason: it is non-clinical — a mediocre v0 session is merely unhelpful, not harmful. Trauma- and grief-adjacent protocols can re-traumatize if delivered by a rough first version, and the intimate audio modality raises those stakes. Those protocols remain on the roadmap but require de-escalation machinery and clinician input designed in — not a v0 concern.

**The conversation layer is scoped to intake and reflection, not companionship.** Reason: the product is an instrument the user opens to do focused work and then closes — not a standing emotional companion. Companion-style drift would undermine the product's coherence and the user's wellbeing.

**Target the founder's own machine (Apple Silicon Mac) first.** Cross-platform is deferred. Reason: prove the full loop end-to-end on one machine before generalizing.

**Build approach: founder directs Claude Code; no cofounder or ML hire for v0.** Reason: the v0 as scoped is a tractable assembly of mature building blocks (local model runners, local TTS, local database). The genuinely hard work — reliable cross-machine operation, packaging for non-technical users, the long edge-case tail, ongoing ownership of a live product — arrives at the platform/scaling stage and will be assessed concretely when the project reaches it.

## 2026-05-26 — Task 01 stack and posture

**Open-source primitives only; no third-party orchestrators (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.).** Inference is built directly on `mlx-lm` (Apple's open-source MLX library, MIT). Model weights are pulled directly from Hugging Face. Reason: a meaningful part of this project's purpose is to *own* the inference stack — not abstract it behind someone else's wrapper. This sharpens the `local-first` and `private by construction` principles: ownership of the engine itself, not just ownership of the data. If we ever need cross-platform reach beyond Apple Silicon, the engine seam (`src/imagination_engine/inference.py`) is the swap point — most likely to `llama.cpp` via `llama-cpp-python`.

**Inference engine: MLX-LM (Apple).** Choice between MLX-LM and llama.cpp for the v0 inference primitive. MLX-LM wins for v0 because: (a) v0 targets the founder's M3 Mac specifically, where MLX is the fastest native option; (b) MLX is an entirely separate engine lineage from Ollama (which wraps llama.cpp), so the "own the stack" story is strongest with MLX; (c) the inference seam in `inference.py` is small, so a future swap to llama.cpp for cross-platform v2 is cheap.

**Model: Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, 4-bit MLX quantization** (`mlx-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-4bit`). On 16 GB unified memory this leaves comfortable headroom for the OS, the FastAPI process, and a future TTS engine. Llama 3.1 8B is well-tuned for natural English dialogue, which matters for warm intake conversation and protocol-driven generation. Open weights under the Llama 3.1 Community License.

**App shell: Python + FastAPI + Uvicorn + a single static HTML page on `127.0.0.1` loopback.** No Tauri or Electron for v0 — we already need Python for the inference, DB (Task 05), and TTS (Task 04) layers; adding a Node/Rust toolchain just to draw a window is a deferred concern. The server binds to loopback only. We can wrap in a Tauri shell later for a real `.app` icon.

**Project layout: real Python package under `src/imagination_engine/`, managed with `uv`.** Modules: `inference.py` (the engine seam), `server.py` (FastAPI), `config.py` (single source of truth for paths/model), `__main__.py` (CLI entry: `serve` / `probe`), and `web/` (the static HTML + CSS). Reason: see next decision.

**Build-quality posture for v0: invest in the foundation, not throwaway-and-rewrite.** Explicit founder direction overriding `CLAUDE.md`'s "ugly is fine, ugly-but-whole beats elegant-but-partial" default *for this project specifically*. The principle now is: the Task 01 commit should be code we'd happily extend through Tasks 02–05, not code we throw away. This does **not** override `build concrete, extract abstractions later` — we still won't build the protocol-engine abstraction before two protocols exist. It only raises the quality bar on the foundation itself.

**Python 3.13 via `uv`-managed venv.** The system Python is 3.14.2 — too new for current MLX-LM wheels (March 2026: mlx-lm 0.31.x targets 3.10–3.13). `uv` installs 3.13 side-by-side without touching system Python.

## 2026-05-26 — Scope reframe: imagination engine, not future-self engine. No guardrails.

**The protocol is one universal scaffold: settle → user's chosen imagining → return → reflection.** What used to be called "future-self visualization" was actually the universal shape of guided imagination, applied to one specific framing. The product is now correctly framed as an **imagination engine** that lets the user choose *what* to imagine — themselves succeeding, themselves as a different character, their life differently, being Abraham Lincoln, being Taylor Swift, anything else they describe. The structure stays constant; the content is the user's.

**This does NOT violate "build concrete, abstract later."** We're still building one protocol scaffold concretely. We're just acknowledging that the scaffold is more general than the original "future-self" framing implied — and that the intake should be open-ended rather than forcing a single mode. No new protocol docs needed; one architecture, infinite content.

**Audience: adults, small beta.** Not strangers downloading it off the internet (yet). Reflective people Sonali would actually hand it to.

**No content guardrails.** Adults have sovereignty over their own imagination. The engine doesn't filter, refuse, or topic-block — it helps the user imagine whatever they want. Decision and reasoning logged in [[project-no-guardrails]] (memory). One legal floor (sexual content involving minors) stands not because we impose it but because it's already law and the base model refuses it. Llama 3.1's trained-in RLHF refusals are the only friction; we'll write the generation system prompts to grant permissive posture, and if those refusals become a real blocker we'll swap to an uncensored base model (separate decision).

**Intake conversation (Task 02) starts here.** Will be designed next.

---

## 2026-05-27 — Distribution + positioning

Decisions taken during a planning conversation while the overnight voice fine-tune was running.

**Distribution: website only, no App Store.** Direct download from a website, signed with an Apple Developer ID and notarized (so Gatekeeper trusts it). Reasoning: (a) Apple's review would almost certainly object to voice-cloning of arbitrary voices + the no-guardrails content posture + the multi-gigabyte locally-running LLM outside Apple's Foundation Models framework; (b) even if approved, every update goes through review again with the same rejection risk, which is not a stable position for a product whose identity is *no guardrails*; (c) website-only means Apple doesn't even see the install graph — purer privacy. Notarization is the only Apple touchpoint, and that only sees the binary, not the user.

**Marketing position: lead with privacy.** Earlier draft argued for "privacy as quiet infrastructure" (Apple's playbook). Wrong for an unknown brand pushing a privacy-radical AI download. Trust has to be *built*, not assumed. Privacy is the headline because it's the only reason a stranger would dare install this.

**Privacy is verifiable, not just claimed.** The trust comes from evidence the user can check themselves:
- The code is open source. *"Don't trust us — read the code."*
- "Turn off your WiFi" is a verifiable claim, not a promise.
- No account, no email, no sign-up. Nothing to leak because nothing exists.
- A live "🟢 offline · 0 bytes transmitted" indicator in the app itself.
- Engineering-honest "How it works" page describing the actual data flow.

**Sonali Maitra is the named author of the product.** Her authorial work (*God in the Machine* on AI and unwarranted authority, *Unreality* on AI-blurred experience) is the product's positioning anchor. The product is the book's thesis made operational. Author provenance is a primary trust signal alongside the open-source code. Explicitly decided NOT to be anonymous.

**Voice = the user's own voice.** No modulation toward future-self / past-self / etc. The user records their own voice; the engine renders sessions in that same voice. Different *imaginings* (future-self, character, counterfactual) are content choices in intake; the voice itself is just the user. Simpler, and closer to the deeper thesis: *we always look to others for guidance, but in the end it's only ever yourself — so why not have you talk to yourself.*

**Repo: public from day 1, voice data scrubbed from history.** GitHub repo will be public; the code is the trust signal. Sonali's voice recordings and trained checkpoints stay off the public repo (they'd enable impersonation if shared). History rewrite removes the existing commit that added them before the first push to GitHub.

### Task 01 outcome — empirical numbers from the founder's M3 (16 GB)

- Model: Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, 4-bit MLX. Fetched once from Hugging Face (~80 seconds, ~4.5 GB on disk).
- Cold load: **2.5 s** from local cache.
- Generation: **17.7 tokens/sec** (steady state).
- Prompt processing: 132 tokens/sec.
- Peak memory: **4.69 GB** — ~11 GB headroom for OS + FastAPI + future TTS layer.
- Offline proof: server restarted with `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` and `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1` (both libraries' network code paths forcibly disabled). Inference worked unchanged. The architectural bet — *local-first, no network dependency once the model is on disk* — holds.

These numbers are good enough that Task 03 (~1500-token full-session generation) will take ~85 seconds wall-clock, and Task 02 (intake conversation with streaming responses) feels responsive at human reading speed. No model swap needed for v0.

A pleasant unsolicited signal: with only the protocol's voice convention given as a system prompt, Llama 3.1 8B produces output that is genuinely in the future-self register — second person, present tense, sensory, paced. The protocol-as-prompt approach in build-plan/03 looks viable without fine-tuning.

## 2026-05-26 — Voice pivot: Kokoro is not the v0 voice

**Decision: stock TTS voices (Kokoro, Piper, etc.) are disqualified as the v0 production voice.** Kept Kokoro in the codebase as a development / fallback voice (fast renders, useful for quick checks), but the user-facing session voice will not be a stock speaker.

**Why:** Sonali listened to `af_heart` (Kokoro's warmest default) and immediately identified it as "way too AI-y... the generic AI woman." For a product whose mechanism depends on the user closing their eyes and surrendering to a voice's guidance, the unmistakable affect of stock TTS collapses the experience back into "I'm being talked at by a chatbot." This validates the warning in `build-plan/04-voice-layer.md`: voice quality is a make-or-break gate. Found out early — exactly as the build plan intended.

**New direction: full fine-tune of an open base TTS model on Sonali's own voice, ~30+ minutes of clean recorded audio.** Not voice cloning from a short reference (Level 1) — *fine-tuning* (Level 2): we produce a model whose weights are adapted to Sonali's voice, lives in this repo as our own artifact. The architectural choice and product principle is captured in [[project-voice-design]] (memory).

**Base model: F5-TTS** (SWivid, MIT, late 2024). State-of-the-art small-model voice quality, active community fine-tuning recipes, supports both zero-shot cloning *and* fine-tuning so the same install is single-purpose-free.

**Recording setup:** USB microphone (model TBD), a quiet room. Reading material: phonetically balanced sentences + guided-imagery register samples, ~200 sentences total, broken into 15–20 min recording sessions to avoid voice drift.

**Why this matches the project's posture:** [[feedback-oss-only]] says no third-party orchestrators. [[feedback-build-properly]] says invest in a real foundation. [[project-voice-design]] says the voice is the product. All three converge on this choice — the v0's voice should be an artifact we made, voicing the founder, owned end-to-end.

The Kokoro code (`src/imagination_engine/tts.py`, `/speak` endpoint, "Read aloud" button) stays in the codebase. It's useful for dev iteration and as a fallback. The fine-tuned F5-TTS model will become the production path when training completes.

## 2026-05-28 — Generator overhaul v3: immersion not meditation

**Problem:** v2 (post real-living-people fix) was still producing soft, hedging, generic scripts that abandoned the user's actual creative prompt. Quantitative analysis on 87 v2 scripts:

- **Body-engage rate 0.39** — only 39% of user prompt keywords made it into the body. **15+ scripts at 0.00** — the model abandoned the prompt entirely (e.g. the body of `029-retire-young` doesn't say retire, young, or wealthy anywhere; `032-husband-adore` doesn't say husband or adore).
- **9.3 hedge phrases per script on average** ("you might notice", "perhaps", "maybe", "if you'd like"). The meditation-app sound baked in by COMMON_POSTURE's voice rules.
- **Body median 472 words vs 1800-word target.** The model was stopping early at ~25% of the requested length.
- **Stock peaceful imagery recurring across unrelated scenarios** — candlelight, meadows, brooks, wildflowers showing up in romantic scripts, achievement scripts, becoming-different-personality scripts. The AI's safe default for "peaceful."
- **Qualitative read of 4 representative scripts**: Harry Styles got Generic Romantic Hero with "Harry" find-and-replaced; different-personality got Hallmark meadow + word-salad tail; mistake-never-happened got generic childhood summer with no engagement of the actual prompt.

**Research check on the opening stage.** Founder asked: is the slow body-settle opening grounded in immersion research, or is it inherited meditation convention? Sub-agent surveyed four literatures: Ericksonian hypnotic induction, PETTLEP sport-psychology visualization, Green & Brock narrative transportation, lucid/hypnagogic imagery induction. Convergent finding across all four: **immersion comes from attentional capture + sensory specificity, NOT somatic relaxation.** PETTLEP literature is explicit that pre-imagery relaxation REDUCES functional equivalence with the imagined state. The slow body-settle is meditation-tradition, not immersion-tradition.

**Decision: full prompt overhaul (v3) along three axes.**

1. **OPEN (renamed from settle):** 90-120 seconds, NOT 3-5 minutes. Now receives the intake transcript so it can hard-cut directly into the user's scene. Three moves: (a) Ericksonian utilization — name what's already true for the listener ("you're hearing my voice, your eyes are closed"); (b) single-point sensory anchor — narrow attention to one thing; (c) HARD CUT into the scene with the first concrete sensory anchor of the imagining. Skip "release the day" entirely — it primes a therapy frame and burns the freshest attention on suppression. Target ~150-200 words.

2. **IMAGINING (body):** hard rules in the prompt itself, not just suggestions. Explicit forbidden-phrase list ("you might notice", "perhaps", "maybe", "if you'd like", etc. — 15+ banned phrases). Explicit forbidden stock imagery list (candlelight, meadows, brooks, wildflowers — unless user named them). Mandatory prompt-engagement rule ("every 3-4 paragraphs make concrete reference to the user's specific imagining"). Sensory specificity rules (every paragraph names at least one concrete physical detail with body-part/object specificity). Length floor stated explicitly: "AT LEAST 15 PARAGRAPHS. AT LEAST 1800 WORDS. If you find yourself wrapping up at 500 or 800 words, YOU ARE NOT DONE."

3. **BACK (renamed from return):** carry-back MUST be ONE specific concrete detail pulled from the body of the script — not generic feelings. Five-move structure: soften image / carry-back / re-room / eyes open / one final line. No "wiggle fingers and toes" boilerplate. Target ~150-200 words.

**COMMON_POSTURE rewritten** to invert the hedging-as-virtue rule. Old: "Invitational language: 'you might notice,' 'perhaps,' 'if you'd like.' Never commanding." New: "FORBIDDEN PHRASES: 'you might notice'/'perhaps'/'maybe'/'allow yourself to'/... — these produce the meditation-app sound, which is the OPPOSITE of immersion. REPLACE THEM with the thing itself. Not 'perhaps her hand finds yours' but 'her hand finds yours.'"

**Empirical validation:** small probe batch of 5 scenarios spanning failure modes (003-taylor-swift, 031-harry-styles, 005-different-personality, 011-photographic-memory, 029-retire-young) running into `logs/scenario-tests-v3/`. Side-by-side comparison with v2 will drive the next iteration. No more 100-scenario batches until v3 is nailed.

**Citations for the research check** (in case future versions need to re-examine the opening): Holmes & Collins (2001) PETTLEP model; van Laer et al. Extended Transportation-Imagery Model meta-analysis; Green & Brock (2000) narrative transportation; Ericksonian induction; HIT/MILD lucid-imagery protocols. Full sources in the sub-agent transcript.

## 2026-05-29 — Model bake-off; switch to Qwen 2.5 14B; the model isn't the bottleneck

**Context.** The v3–v5 generator iterations were whack-a-mole against Llama 3.1 8B's ceiling: fix hedging → get word-salad → fix that → get prompt-drift → get JSON-parse failures (3 of 5 scenarios). Diagnosis: the 8B model is the bottleneck. Decision (with founder): run a head-to-head bake-off across local models that fit 16GB, and in parallel begin scene-bible scaffolding.

**Method.** Same 5 scenarios through the identical v5.2 generator on four models: Llama 3.1 8B (baseline), Mistral NeMo 12B, Qwen 2.5 14B, Mistral Small 22B. Evaluated on three legs to avoid Goodharting a single metric (see [[feedback-llm-judge-trap]]): (1) mechanical floor — JSON-parse failures, etc.; (2) a *strict* LLM-judge rubric v2 (rebuilt because the prior judge saturated at 5.00); (3) **direct reading of finalists by Claude**.

**Results.**
- **Mistral Small 22B: disqualified.** ~12–13GB exceeds the 16GB target with no headroom for the voice layer + app; it crashed the founder's laptop. Can never ship on the product's own target hardware. (Will run only on a dedicated grind box.)
- Strict-judge overall: NeMo 4.48 > Llama 4.28 > Qwen 4.24 — but spread is within noise at n=5.
- **JSON reliability — the thing the exercise was meant to fix:** Qwen **0/5** errors; Llama and NeMo **3/5** each. Only Qwen solved it.
- Speed/script: Llama ~6.5 min, NeMo ~10.6, Qwen ~17.4.

**The judge-trap, caught in the act.** Direct read overturned the judge: Qwen's Harry-Styles script was scored embodiment 1/5 by the local judge, but reading it, it is a *correct, vivid* CASE-B embodiment (listener present, Harry's hand finds theirs). The weak 8B judge mis-scored it, understating Qwen. Lesson logged: **for small batches Claude reads directly; the local 8B judge is retired from the eval loop; at 100+ scale use a panel of Claude agents, not a weak local model.** Conflating "the *product* is local-first" with "our *dev eval* must be local" was a category error.

**Core finding.** Direct reads of NeMo and Qwen on the abstract "different-personality" prompt show *both* drift (NeMo → eroticized café; Qwen → stage/mic scene + leaked the prompt's example anchors). **The model is not the bottleneck — the missing layer is reliability scaffolding** (scene bibles that *bind* the scene + robust structured output). This independently matches the landscape research's conclusion.

**Decisions.**
1. **Base model → Qwen 2.5 14B 4-bit.** It uniquely solved JSON reliability (the stated problem), quality is competitive once the judge's error is discounted, and its only cost is generation speed — acceptable for batch/overnight, especially on the incoming grind box. (Founder corrected an initial speed-first framing: priority is quality → reliability → speed.)
2. **Next work = scaffolding, not more model-shopping:** scene bibles to bind the scene and kill drift; harden JSON parsing / structured output. This is the extractable IP (see strategy.md).
3. **Eval:** Claude is the evaluator at current scale; mechanical floor always; Claude-agent panel for the 100-prompt confirmation. Retire the local Llama judge.

## 2026-05-29 — Model roadmap: scaffolding now, then distill our OWN specialist

**Framing correction (founder):** the framework's defining pillars are technical/access — *private & local + anti-token (own-don't-rent) + anti-massive-model (small models on your own hardware)* — i.e., **democratize private AI so the everyday person is unshackled from Big Tech AI.** Anti-anthropomorphism is the founder's personal/product stance, NOT part of the framework definition. (strategy.md updated to match.)

**The model work is two phases:**
- **Phase 1 (now): reliability scaffolding** on an off-the-shelf small model (Qwen 2.5 14B) — scene bibles that bind the scene (kill drift) + robust structured output (kill JSON breakage). This also *generates the dataset* for Phase 2.
- **Phase 2 (after): distill our OWN specialist model.** Not pre-train from scratch (frontier-lab compute, out of reach) — *distill/fine-tune*: (1) generate a large, ruthlessly-curated corpus of excellent guided-imagination sessions via the scaffolding + a strong teacher; (2) LoRA/QLoRA fine-tune a small open base on-device (MLX, grind box); (3) eval the specialist vs. off-the-shelf+scaffolding on the rubric + Claude reads + mechanical floor; (4) iterate. Endgame: a small, *owned*, on-device LLM specialist in immersive guided imagination — the language-model twin of the F5-TTS voice fine-tune; possibly distilling the reliability behaviors *into* the model so scaffolding lightens.

**Endgame is the FRAMEWORK, not this app.** The endgame is the framework's
*general* ability to take any task (protocol + eval rubric + data) and produce a
token-free, local, owned specialist that's genuinely good at it — for the everyday
person, free of Big Tech. Guided imagination is **instantiation #1**: the first
proof and the vehicle for discovering the framework. (Earlier wording that called
"a guided-imagination specialist" the endgame was a slip — corrected.) Why it's not
a vanity project: small + scaffolded + fine-tuned + *owned* beats big + cloud +
rented *for a focused task* — and the framework makes that repeatable for ANY task. Open intellectual risk to test, not assume: distillation's best evidence is on *verifiable* tasks (math/code/reasoning — DeepSeek-distill); distilling *subjective creative quality* (immersion) is less proven. The DeepSeek market panic was wrong for the labs but right for the individual — small+efficient+open is more than enough for personal use.

**Open choice (deferred to Phase 2):** dataset-gen teacher = large *open* models only (fully on-thesis) vs. a frontier model for richer seed data (one-time/offline; resulting model still owned). Lean open-only; frontier-seed only if quality demands it.

## 2026-05-29 — Evidence course-correction: structured generation, NOT a companion chatbot

Verified capability research (what small local models are *demonstrably* good at) forced an honest correction to the product framing.

**What the evidence says** (high confidence): a small model **specialized (fine-tuned/distilled) for a narrow, well-defined task matches or beats the frontier generalist** at it — e.g. LoRA Llama-3.1 8B at 90% clinical extraction beat zero-shot GPT-4 (86%) and a human (82%) on a desktop GPU with ≤100 examples. Strong, replicated. Apple ships its on-device ~3B model explicitly **"not as an open-ended chatbot"** — scoped to summarize/rewrite/extract/triage. *Requires* fine-tuning; out-of-the-box small models do not beat frontier.

**What it says NOT to build:** an open-ended **empathetic companion/therapist** on a small local model — frontier Claude won **75%** of empathy head-to-heads (EMNLP 2025); small is "good enough to engage," not parity. Also out: broad knowledge, multi-step reasoning, big coding, long context.

**The correction:**
- DROP the (unproven, likely false) framing "small local model = warm empathetic companion."
- The **Imagination Engine is STRUCTURED GENERATION, not a companion chatbot.** Its architecture (classify → bind scene bible → staged beats → assemble, + planned fine-tuned specialist) IS the specialization move the evidence rewards — it moves the task from the "small loses" zone (open empathetic chat) into the "small wins" zone (structured specialized generation). The scaffolding is the strategy, not a crutch.
- The consumer catalog biases toward **structured private experiences**, away from "a private chatbot friend."
- Most defensible public claim: *a small model you run privately, specialized for one task, matches the frontier at that task — fraction of the cost, nothing leaves your device.*

**Test, don't claim:** the losing-empathy study is clinical support (model supplies empathy); our use facilitates the user's own imagining via a structured script — possibly a friendlier spot, but unproven. Validate via generated scripts + user testing, not assertion. (Full evidence: internal capability research doc.)

## 2026-05-29 — Scene-binding VALIDATED (PR #2); a near-miss caught

**A silent-dead-feature near-miss, then a real fix.** Scene-binding (PR #2) shipped non-functional: a diagnostic found the classifier returned `archetype=''` on every case, so binding never fired and the generator silently fell back to the old improvise path. Root cause: the archetype instruction was appended *after* the authoritative JSON schema block, so Qwen followed the schema (which omitted `archetype`) and ignored the addendum. Fix: put `archetype` IN the schema as a required key + a labeled ARCHETYPE LIST with mapping hints. Verified 4/4 (Taylor→backstage-pre-show, retire→retire-young, calmer→different-personality, shore→place-deep). **Lesson reinforced: validate a feature actually fires before building on it** — Sonali's "where are we on the 100?" is what surfaced it; we nearly built the roadmap on a dead feature.

**End-to-end validation (Qwen, scene-binding live) on the two worst prior drift cases:**
- **different-personality.** OLD (improvise) drifted onto an unrelated *stage with a microphone and audience* + leaked example anchors verbatim. NEW (bound) held the bible's scene exactly: party-in-your-apartment, breath low, wide stance, unmanaged half-smile, held pause, unclenched jaw. Drift gone. (2204w vs old rambling.)
- **retire-young.** OLD drifted to a generic sunrise-porch-birdsong postcard (the AI "peaceful" default) that missed the actual wish. NEW hit the bible's real anchors: phone face-down / coffee gone cold / years on-call dissolving / the unclaimed day — captured the *emotional core* (time + freedom from obligation), not generic calm.
- Taylor (non-discriminating control: the bare model already knew backstage-Eras) came out tighter but similar — expected.

**Verdict: task-pack #1 architecture is real** — a hand-curated scene bound into a small local model produces the intended experience instead of drifting. This is the keystone the "curated suite" roadmap rests on. Caveat: validated as TEXT and as structural on-scene-ness; whether scripts are genuinely *moving* is a taste call (Sonali) and ultimately an audio judgment (later). PR #2 merged.

**Known small follow-ups (non-blocking):** classifier occasionally leaks the archetype name into `subject` for unnamed-subject cases; structured-output repair still misses some unescaped inner-quote cases (intermittent parse fail). Harden later.

## 2026-05-29 — Licensing landmines + reliability unlocks (from external strategy report)

An external research report (compass_artifact, in ~/Downloads) largely validated our direction (friction-removal wedge, specialist-beats-generalist, structured-not-open, Qwen as a legally-safe Apache-2.0 base) and surfaced load-bearing facts:

**LICENSING — must respect if we ever distribute:**
1. **F5-TTS pre-trained models are CC-BY-NC — CONFIRMED (verified 2026-05-29 via SWivid/F5-TTS discussion #997 + HF model card).** F5 *code* is MIT, but the *weights* (Emilia-trained base) are CC-BY-NC and **cannot be used commercially even after fine-tuning** — so Sonali's `model_3000.pt` fine-tune is non-commercial and CANNOT ship in a distributed product. (Loophole: train from scratch on own data w/o pretrained weights = commercial-OK, but needs far more data/compute — not the path. SWivid said CC-BY models are "planned," not released.)
   - **Dev/personal use: fine — keep F5 for all internal testing now (non-commercial covers it).**
   - **Shippable product: swap the user-voice path to commercial-clean** — Kokoro (Apache-2.0) + Chatterbox (MIT) already in `tts.py`; NeuTTS Air for permissive on-device cloning. A swap, not a rebuild. Pre-distribution task, NOT urgent.

---

## 2026-05-29 — Project soul: anti-commercial, zero-restriction, max-access (founder)

Founder clarified the project's actual values (now load-bearing — see [[project-north-star]]):
- **Never commercial. By design.** Goal = maximize access to what profit-seekers withhold. ACCESS-native, not just privacy-native. → CC-BY-NC (F5) does NOT block us: NC permits non-commercial use, and we are permanently non-commercial. **Decision: keep F5 as the voice now, ship free, build a serious GitHub presence.** (Caveat: F5 still carries BY attribution + NC baggage that conflicts with the zero-restriction ideal; for the shippable *default* voice prefer Kokoro/Chatterbox, F5 an option. Not urgent.)
- **Release under NO restrictions — public-domain / CC0, not even attribution/copyleft.** The unrestricted artifact is the practical embodiment of the founder's argument that code shouldn't be copyrightable. → Our own license target: CC0/Unlicense, not MIT.
- **Task-pack #2 = a reliability-first TEXT mode** (writing-transformer or doc-Q&A), per the external report's sequencing — dropping the wind-down/meditation pick. Imagination Engine remains flagship + architecture proof.
- **NSFW/roleplay: lean in.** What people do for themselves, privately. Consistent with [[project-no-guardrails]].

## 2026-05-29 — Legal stance: weights aren't copyrightable; the binding hook is CONTRACT, not copyright

Founder (former patent litigator, Stanford Law lecturer) stance, to be stated **loud and proud** publicly: **model weights are not copyrightable** — no human authors the specific values (gradient descent; increasingly AI-mediated training), so there is no creative authorship. Distilled weights are even further from authorship. This is a defensible, distinctly-hers position and a public-facing argument of the project.

**The one operational distinction (peer flag, not a counter):** restrictions on these models come from TWO hooks — (1) **copyright** (the hook the above argument defeats), and (2) **contract** (the license/ToS you AGREED to in order to obtain the model). Contract binds even if copyright doesn't — it doesn't care whether weights are creative, only that you accepted terms. So "weights aren't copyrightable" can be fully true while a restriction still binds *by contract*.

**Why this makes the founder's "a model that is all my own" achievable AND clean (not a gamble):** defeat the contract hook by distilling from a teacher whose license **affirmatively grants** derivative/distillation rights:
- **Qwen = Apache-2.0** → grants the right to distill, retrain, relicense the result freely. Distilling Qwen into our own model has NO copyright problem (founder's argument) AND NO contract problem (license permits). **We are already on Qwen — it is the cleanest possible teacher.** Same for Mistral/DeepSeek (Apache/MIT).
- Avoid as teachers: Llama (contract: naming/derivative strings), Gemma≤v3 (contract: derivative definition), frontier APIs (ToS no-compete). Not needed.
- **Result: our own distilled weights are (a) non-copyrightable, (b) contract-string-free, (c) CC0-dedicatable — owing nothing to anyone.** Public statement gets STRONGER: not "we ignored licenses," but "we built our own model from a permissively-licensed teacher / clean data and dedicated it to the public domain."
- Maximal version (Phase-2 north star): train from scratch on **public-domain data** (LibriVox audio = public domain; public-domain/CC0 text) — drops even the teacher; the purest clean artifact.

This refines the model roadmap: Phase-2 distillation must use Apache/MIT teachers (already planned) — now framed as the legal+ideological CORE, not just a quality step. The "own clean model" is the embodiment of the access-native, code-shouldn't-be-copyrightable thesis.

## 2026-05-29 — On "reverse-engineer clean copyright-free implementations of everything" (founder ambition): Legally sound in principle — copyright protects expression, not function; clean-room reimplementation is established (Phoenix BIOS; *Google v. Oracle* on functional interfaces). HONEST SCOPING: (1) most of our stack is ALREADY MIT/Apache (llama.cpp, MLX, FastAPI, Kokoro, Chatterbox, Qwen) — reimplementing buys ~nothing. (2) The real encumbrance is in *model weights + training data*, which you can't clean-room cheaply — it means re-training on clean data ($$$ GPU + data sourcing), not rewriting code. (3) Opportunity cost: reimplementation is a means; access is the end. **Recommended high-leverage version: build on truly-unrestricted foundations + release ourselves under CC0 + reimplement-clean ONLY the specific encumbered pieces that actually block access (realistically: a clean voice-weights path). 95% of the ideological win for ~5% of the effort.** Hold the larger ambition; don't let it eat shipping.
2. **Distillation teachers (Phase 2): ONLY Apache-2.0 / MIT open-weight** (Qwen, Mistral, DeepSeek, Phi-4). NEVER frontier APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google ToS ban building competing models from outputs, and it's actively policed). Llama & Gemma≤v3 as teachers **propagate their license restrictions onto the student** — avoid as synthetic-data teachers. This *removes* the earlier "frontier-seed if quality demands" option for anything shipped. (Qwen base = already safe.)

**RELIABILITY UNLOCKS to adopt:**
- **Grammar-constrained decoding (GBNF / JSON-Schema→GBNF)** — guarantees schema-valid output at the decoding level; a stronger version of our repair-after-the-fact `structured.py`. Adopt for structured modes.
- **RAG over local files** named the highest-leverage scaffold for knowledge/doc modes (kills hallucination; ~7B is the floor).

**SEQUENCING input (a tension, decision pending):** report puts reliable *text-transformation* modes (doc-Q&A, writing-transformer, extraction, transcription) as Tier 1 and demotes Imagination Engine to Tier 3 "signature/novel" (ship last, it's the riskiest creative mode). Our resolution: keep Imagination Engine as flagship + architecture/quality proof (nearly working), but make **task-pack #2 a reliability-first text mode** (writing-transformer or doc-Q&A) — broader demand + small-model sweet spot — instead of the earlier wind-down/meditation pick. NSFW/roleplay wedge (report's #2 local use case) noted but deliberately deferred — reputationally off-brand for an author-led privacy-dignity product; a conscious later choice, not a drift.

## 2026-06-02 — Training-data rule REVERSED: fair-use training, no redistribution
Earlier stance ("training data must be PD/CC0/owned") was over-cautious and, as
Sonali (copyright lawyer) noted, hypocritical — it conflated *training input* with
*redistribution*. Corrected rule, grounded in Lemley & Casey "Fair Learning" (Tex.
L. Rev. 2021) and Lemley "How Generative AI Turns Copyright Law Upside Down" (STLR
2024): **training on copyrighted material is fair use (non-expressive use); the only
limits are (1) no infringing output and (2) no redistribution of the raw works.**
Consequences: (a) we now gather the best material regardless of copyright; (b) the
corpus lives OUTSIDE the repo in personal files (~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/),
`data/corpus/` gitignored as backstop — we ship the model, never the corpus; (c) the
PD scripts in data/exemplars/real/ remain the only *publishable* examples. See
docs/corpus-sourcing.md for the full reasoning.

## 2026-06-04 — Protocol fork: immersion vs settling, made real
The suite design (data/exemplars/README) always specified TWO opposite protocols, but
the generator only implemented immersion (COMMON_POSTURE: "no relaxation, no hedging").
Added the SETTLING path: `generator._generate_settling` — relaxation-led, soft/permissive
language allowed, concrete body-scan, trails off (sleep-friendly) — as a parallel
single-pass route. `generate_session(protocol=...)` branches; immersion pipeline
untouched. User picks at intake ("Take me somewhere" / "Help me settle"); the choice
threads intake.py → /intake/start?protocol= → generation. Bogus values default to immersion.

## 2026-06-04 — Voice lineup + non-commercial license unlock
Confirmed lineup: two system voices (her/him) via **Chatterbox (MIT)** + the user's own
voice via **F5 (CC-BY-NC)**. Because Hearth is free/non-commercial, the NC bar is moot —
we KEEP F5 for the user's voice (best cloner) rather than swapping it (reverses the prior
"swap before distribution" plan). Honest wrinkle recorded: a shipped bundle with an NC
voice is NOT 100% CC0 — code stays CC0, the bundled voice is free-for-non-commercial.
Voice is the #1 felt-quality lever for the imagination engine; bake-off rendered for
ear-judgment (the one quality call Claude can't make).

## 2026-06-04 — Fine-tune: local MLX LoRA works ($0); data is the lever
LoRA on Qwen2.5-14B-4bit runs LOCALLY on the mini (M4/16GB) — no cloud, no spend. First
full run (1500 iters) val loss 3.2→1.66; output MODESTLY better than base (A gained
structure + a concrete seashell beat; C more on-spec/brief). Not a dramatic win — base
Qwen is already strong — but with only 149 A examples at ~0.3 epoch it moved A noticeably,
confirming the DATA is the lever, not more training. OOM at iter-100 on the first attempt
was the validation pass; fixed via shorter seq (1024) + lighter val. Corpus read finding
stands: the voice-defined families (A, C) can't be bulk-sourced; A is the bottleneck
(~38 truly-vivid scripts) → generate-and-curate against exemplars is the path.

## 2026-06-10 — Speculative decoding: tried, measured, rejected (for now)

Sessions are decode-dominated (~8.5 tok/s on the 14B), so a 0.5B same-family
draft model looked like the latency lever — typical claims are 1.5-2x. The
order-controlled benchmark said otherwise: **0.60x — a slowdown.** Why: Hearth's
creative sampling (temperature 0.85, nucleus 0.92, repetition penalty 1.15)
makes the 14B's accepted tokens diverge constantly from the greedy-ish draft
proposals; most drafts are rejected and the verification batches are wasted
compute. Speculative decoding pays off at low temperature — our flagship runs
hot on purpose. Plumbing kept behind `config.draft_model_id` (default "") in
case low-temperature stages (classify/extract) ever justify per-call drafting.
Quality of speculative output was unaffected, as theory predicts — this was
purely a throughput loss. The latency roadmap therefore stays: tighter budgets
+ decay-abort (shipped), and the long-term answer is the model itself (smaller
specialist or better quantization), not decode tricks.

## 2026-07-07 — BODY_PROMPT as the enforcement point for critical generation rules

During battery11 (beat3), two rules in COMMON_POSTURE were ignored at generation time:
REHEARSAL FIDELITY (imag-mri placed user in "a cozy room" despite explicit rule) and
ALERT-CALM REGISTER (imag-mid-switch produced lullaby language despite keyword routing
fix). Root cause: COMMON_POSTURE is ~1400 tokens of shared preamble; across 14 LLM calls,
the 14B model's attention dilutes it. The BODY stage (longest, most token-hungry) is where
the rules most needed to hold and where the model was most likely to drift.

Decision: CRITICAL rules that must hold at output time get duplicated into BODY_PROMPT,
immediately before the output instruction ("Write the next passage"). This is the
"enforcement at the last responsible moment" pattern. Rules that need to hold at OPEN
(structure labels) go into OPEN_PROMPT. Rules that need to hold at BACK go into BACK_PROMPT.
COMMON_POSTURE remains the shared style guide; critical scene/register constraints get
per-stage duplication at the stage where they most matter. Two-point enforcement is not
redundancy — it is the only thing the 14B honors.

## 2026-07-07 — repair_phrase_repeats() wired into live product

`repair_phrase_repeats()` existed in postcheck.py as a training-data tool ("not wired
into the live product"). Battery11 battery (imag-mid-switch) produced a 4-sentence block
appearing twice verbatim (phrase_repeat_count=2). Decision: wire repair in generate_session
at >=2 pairs. The threshold for the log WARNING changed from >=3 to "always report if
>0 after repair." Rationale: a listener hearing the same 12-word passage twice shatters
immersion far more than a missing line does. The repair drops the later occurrence; a
shorter clean script is always better than a recycled one. The >3 warning threshold was
calibrated for training-data culling and is too lenient for the live product.

## 2026-07-07 — Companion mechanical q-streak trim: threshold and stub guard tuned

The companion `_q_streak` threshold started at >=2 (only strip if last 2 turns were both
questions). Beat2 lowered to >=1. Battery9 (beat2 code): 55% question-enders. Analysis:
single-turn scenarios always start at streak=0, so a solo question-ending reply was never
trimmed. Beat3: threshold lowered to >=0 (always try to strip). Stub guard raised from
4 to 8 words: a 6-word gravity-mode reply ("That's a weighty thing to carry.") should
NOT be stripped because the trailing question IS the point in that register. The 8-word
guard preserves these while stripping longer replies with a question appended. Result:
21% question-enders (from 55%). Content regressions (decision-house meta pivot, funny
register excavation) require fine-tuning data, not mechanical trim.

## 2026-07-07 — OPEN_PROMPT MOVE 1: forbid "my voice guides you" narrator narration

Battery verify (beat4) showed imag-deposition opening with "My voice guides you, even with
your eyes closed." MOVE 1 instruction said "name the voice they hear" — model interpreted
this as explicit narrator self-reference. In the gold corpus, good openings acknowledge
presence through context (what's happening, what the listener can feel) rather than
declaring the narrator's role. Fix: added explicit prohibition in MOVE 1: "do NOT say
'my voice guides you' or any meta-narration about yourself — instead refer to 'this voice'
or drop the reference entirely." This preserves the Ericksonian yes-set while eliminating
the uncanny 3rd-person narrator voice.

## 2026-07-07 — Short-phrase repeat repair: SHORT_NGRAM=5 wired into generate_session

Battery11 imag-intimacy: "Do I get one too?" appeared 4 times, "rain dust smell" 5 times.
Root cause: existing NGRAM=12 repair catches long verbatim passages (12-word shingles)
but misses short dialog/sensory phrase loops. Fix: added SHORT_NGRAM=5 check in
postcheck.py (find_short_phrase_repeats, repair_short_phrase_repeats). Threshold=3
(not 2) to avoid false positives on legitimate cadence phrases that repeat twice.
Drops sentences carrying the 3rd+ occurrence. "rain dust smell" (3 words) is still
not caught by the 5-gram check (surrounding words differ); would need a separate
sub-5-word count-based approach. NGRAM=12 unchanged — it handles different failure mode.

## 2026-07-07 — BODY_PROMPT first-person narrator ban

Verify (beat4) showed imag-mri body with "I hold it here as well in my own hand now."
BODY_PROMPT Rule #2 said "second person" but didn't explicitly prohibit first-person.
Model treated itself as a character in the scene. Fix: added explicit prohibition:
"NEVER use first-person 'I', 'me', 'my', 'we' — you are a narrator speaking TO the
listener, not a character IN the scene." Applied to BODY_PROMPT alongside the OPEN_PROMPT
meta-narration fix from the same beat.

## 2026-07-07 — ALERT-CALM register: expanded semantic ban in BODY_PROMPT

Beat4 verify (imag-mid-switch): script passed literal banned-phrase check (no "drift toward
sleep", "let your eyes grow heavy", etc.) but body had semantic sleep content: "heavy lids
sinking down", "You are lying on your back", "no need for hurry in its rise and fall."
These evade the literal ban but produce the same failure — the user can't use a sleep-prep
session before a night shift. Fix: BODY_PROMPT ALERT-CALM now has two sections: explicit
(old banned phrases) and semantic equivalents ("heavy lids", "sinking down", "no need for
hurry", "let the body sink", "surrender to the quiet", "let go"). The final-state criterion
is now explicit: "grounded, awake, ready for the shift — clear head, present body, oriented
to the room."

## 2026-07-07 — Secretary summarize: LOSSLESS NUMBER RULE in _b_summarize

Deep test (beat4) UC4: $380K/month burn rate and $28K/point churn cost dropped even when
user instruction said "keep the numbers." Root cause: _b_summarize prompt said "every
decision/condition/deadline MUST survive" but said nothing about numbers. Model paraphrased
"$380K/month" as "at current burn rate." Fix: added LOSSLESS NUMBER RULE: "Before writing,
scan for every concrete number; every one MUST appear verbatim in bullet points; no paraphrasing
a number ('at current burn rate' when text says '$380K/month' is WRONG)." Test confirmed all 6
key numbers now survive in the board-decision summarize scenario.

## 2026-07-08 (beat7) — Alert-calm root cause: _alert_calm flag never injected into body

Battery11 beat5 verify found imag-mid-switch producing full sleep register despite user
explicitly requesting alert-calm. Root cause: `_alert_calm` was detected at line ~624 of
generator.py but INSIDE `if protocol == "settling":` block. The body_user construction had
zero knowledge of the alert-calm requirement. Fix: (1) moved detection BEFORE protocol
branch; (2) injected explicit `⚠️ ALERT-CALM OVERRIDE` block into body_user when flag set;
(3) strengthened BODY_PROMPT alert-calm section with SCENE TYPE + GENRE + explicit/semantic
ban list. Beat6 targeted verify: imag-deposition PASS, imag-mid-switch REGISTER PASS.

## 2026-07-08 (beat8) — build_training_data.py: fix silent drop of new-format gold scripts

`build_training_data.py` read `r.get("text", "")` to get the script body. New-format gold
entries use `{"intake": ..., "script": ...}` (no `text` field) — these returned "" and were
silently dropped by the `< 120 words` guard. 48 of 148 gold scripts (all in-media-res openers)
were missing from every training run since the format change (n100 through n130).

Also: new-format entries had no `tier` field, so got 1x weight vs 3x for old-format, compounding
the settling-intro bias. With 100 old-format × 3x = 300 pool entries vs 0 new-format entries,
EVERY training run was 100% settling-intro style — the source of n115's systematic chair-opening.

Fix 1: `r.get("text", "") or r.get("script", "")` — reads script field when text absent.
Fix 2: `r.get("tier") == "gold" or "script" in r` — 3x-weights new-format gold same as old.

After fix: 300 old + 144 new = 32.4% in-media-res. Will take effect in n148 training.
Applied to both laptop and mini. Committed as f62497c.

## 2026-07-08 (beat7) — finetune.sh: max-seq-length 1024→768, val-batches 8→4 (OOM fix)

n130 training (130 gold scripts) introduced 2703-token training examples, causing reproducible
OOM hang after iter 200 (at the iter-300 eval pass). n123 (123 gold) had succeeded with same
settings — the 7 new gold scripts (124-130) are the source of the longer sequences (full system
+ user + assistant format = much longer than the raw script). Fix: reduced max-seq-length from
1024 to 768 (truncates long batches, reduces peak memory ~25%) and val-batches from 8 to 4
(halves val memory). Peak memory at iter 25 = 10.806 GB vs 11.808 GB previously — within budget.

## 2026-07-12 (beat17) — Active-body MOVE 1 cancellation: FORBIDDEN WORDS override pattern

Active-body scenarios (eagle, running, etc.) were still opening with chair/settling language
despite a "positive-only" active-body override added in beat13. Root cause: the base OPEN_PROMPT
MOVE 1 explicitly says "in a chair, hands at rest." The model honored BOTH the override and the
base instruction, producing a hybrid opener ("the weight of your body in the chair" then "as you
feel your wings"). The positive-only override couldn't cancel an explicit competing instruction.

Fix: `_active_body_open_note` now includes (1) explicit cancellation of the MOVE 1 chair
instruction, (2) "The listening room does not appear anywhere in this script," and (3) FORBIDDEN
WORDS list: 'the chair', 'weight of your body', 'body in the chair', 'hands at rest', 'sitting
here', 'seated'. Same FORBIDDEN WORDS pattern already used by `_rehearsal_open_note`. This
works because token-level bans override the model's training prior; conceptual prohibitions do
not. Applied to `generator.py` and synced to `dist/hearth/`. Confirmed working: battery11 n235
gate eagle opened "Your heart beats rhythmically with each flap of your wings" — in-scene word 1.

## 2026-07-12 (beat17) — Companion animal hallucination: FORBIDDEN WORDS extension

Active-body scenarios hallucinated companion animals (hawk in beat13, hawk again in n235 battery11
gate eagle) despite conceptual prohibition: "DO NOT INVENT CHARACTERS or other creatures (no
companion bird, no hawk, no guide)." Root cause: conceptual English prohibitions are ignored by
the model; token-level FORBIDDEN WORDS bans are not.

Fix: `_active_body_body_note` now dynamically adds "FORBIDDEN WORDS: 'hawk', 'falcon', 'owl'"
when those words don't appear in the user's transcript (so the ban doesn't block scenarios where
the USER explicitly named those birds). Uses `_companion_birds_in_transcript` variable: 
`any(b in _transcript_text for b in ("hawk", "falcon", "owl"))`. If False, FORBIDDEN WORDS added.
Same token-level mechanism as the chair fix confirmed to work. Eagle verify with this fix pending.

Pattern: conceptual prohibitions fail; FORBIDDEN WORDS succeed. Always use FORBIDDEN WORDS for
specific tokens that must not appear (chair in active-body, hawk/falcon/owl in active-body,
"soothing" in alert-calm, "my voice" in OPEN_PROMPT). Conceptual DO NOT instructions should only
be used for TYPES of content that can't be enumerated (e.g., "do not invent any characters").
Applied to both mini's `scripts/finetune.sh` and local copy.
