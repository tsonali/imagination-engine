"""Build the fine-tune SFT set — balanced across the four families, MLX-LM chat format.

One specialist that does all four tools, taught via per-family SYSTEM prompts (so the
same model behaves as the imagination engine / secretary / companion / instrument
depending on the system message — which is exactly how the product drives it).

Quality over quantity (LIMA): a few thousand clean, balanced, well-curated examples.
Writes ~/Downloads/hearth-corpus/_train/{train.jsonl,valid.jsonl} as
{"messages":[{role:system},{role:user},{role:assistant}]} — the format mlx_lm.lora reads.
