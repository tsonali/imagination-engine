"""Local inference engine — the seam between an open-source primitive and our product.

Wraps `mlx-lm` (Apple's open-source MLX inference library, MIT) to expose a
small, owned `Engine` interface. We use mlx-lm directly — no third-party
orchestrator (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) between us and the weights. Model
weights are fetched directly from Hugging Face.

Future swaps — a different model, llama.cpp instead of MLX, a fine-tune —
happen here, without touching the protocol or server layers.
