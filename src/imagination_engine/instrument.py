"""Instrument — a persistent, personal AI instrument the user builds and keeps.

This is Part D ("build your own"): the framework exposed to the user. An Instrument
is a NAMED, STANDING thing the user sets up once and returns to — "my work
associate," "my Stoic reflection partner," "a gruff sailor mentor." It unifies the
built pieces:
  - a PERSONA (system prompt) — what this instrument is + how it talks
  - optional GROUNDING (RAG over the user's files) — what it KNOWS (rag.py/doc_qa.py)
  - PERSISTENCE — config + per-session memory, so it's standing, not a one-off
Everything local-first; an instrument lives entirely in the user's own files.

Two ways to make it yours (the consumer dialog-box mechanisms):
  - POINT IT AT A FOLDER → it KNOWS your stuff (RAG, instant). "what did the budget
    doc say?"  — handled by the grounding layer.
  - DESCRIBE ITS PERSONA → it BEHAVES how you want, instantly (no training).
  - (fine-tune-on-your-style = the overnight Tier-2 path; future, same registry.)

A registry (local SQLite) tracks the instruments the user has built so they persist
and can be listed/reopened — the "standing, return-to-it" property that distinguishes
Part D (personal) from Family B's one-off tools.
