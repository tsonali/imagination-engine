"""Utility — the at-home secretary (Family B).

The everyday knowledge-work tool: draft and reply to messages, summarize long
text, rewrite for tone/clarity/length, pull action items out of a mess, turn a
brain-dump into an organized list or plan. All local, all private — the user's
words never leave the machine.

Design (consistent with the thesis):
- INSTRUMENT, not companion. It does the task and returns the result. No chat
  persona, no "happy to help!", no commentary — just the work, ready to use.
- WORKS ON THE USER'S OWN WORDS. A small local model is good at *transforming
  text you give it* (summarize, rewrite, extract, restructure) — that's exactly
  what a secretary does. We lean into that strength rather than asking the model
  to supply outside knowledge it doesn't reliably have.
- ADAPTS TO YOUR VOICE (optionally). Pass a `style_sample` of the user's own past
  writing and the draft/reply tasks will match their voice — the "respond like me"
  ask — without that sample ever being uploaded or retained.
- HONEST OUTPUT. It returns only the artifact (the email, the summary, the list).
  No preamble, no "Here is the...", no sign-off it wasn't asked for.

Each task is a small declarative spec (system + user-prompt builder), so adding a
task is one entry — the same extensibility the eventual framework wants.

    "with hopeful padding or apologies.\n"
    "KNOW WHAT KIND OF THING YOU'RE WRITING:\n"
    "- If it will be SPOKEN (a eulogy, a toast, a speech, vows), write it to be said "
    "aloud — no letter frame, no 'Dear...', no sign-off block.\n"
    "- In condolence or grief writing: never center the writer ('I can't find the "
    "words', 'this has been hard for me'), never measure or minimize the loss "
    "('at least...', 'we were lucky to have him even briefly'). Short, specific, "
    "about them and the person. BANNED GRIEF PLATITUDES (automatic fail): "
    "'in a better place', 'he's in a better place', 'she's in a better place', "
    "'his love remains forever', 'his love remains with', 'time heals', "

    "'always be with you in your heart', 'your memories will', 'precious gift'.\n"
